# langflow-streamlit

`langflow-streamlit` is an API that facilitates communication between [Langflow](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) applications. This library enables seamless integration of Langflow's advanced language processing capabilities with Streamlit's user-friendly interface, allowing developers to create interactive applications that leverage powerful language models.

## Features

- **Easy integration:** Quickly set up communication between Langflow and Streamlit with minimal configuration.
- **Simple deployment:** Easily install and run the API with `pip` or `poetry`.
- **Flexible execution:** Run the full stack or just the Streamlit frontend with API backend.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
