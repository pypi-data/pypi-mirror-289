Description: # pytilkit - V1.0.0

        pytilkit is a python library which contains many code snippets that one uses quite a lot. We pride ourselves on backwards compatibility.
        We will not be deprecating any feature or removing it. All old snippet functions will work even if you update the package.

        Hi, I'm ItzSCodez1467 A.K.A. Srijal Dutta. I consider myself an intermediate programmer. In usually work with python for backend and for the frontend which I rarely add to my projects I have made quite a few projects, but I don't want to really share them as they are not really that important. I'll keep adding some projects over time.
        
        ## Usage
        
        > Clear Screen
        
        - Directly call function
        
        ```python
        import pytilkit as ptk
        
        ptk.clearScreen()
        ```
        
        - Use alias function
        
        ```python
        import pytilkit as ptk
        
        ptk.clsScreen()
        ```

        print(z)
        ```
        
        - Subtracting numbers
        
        ```python
        import pytilkit as ptk
        
        z = ptk.sub(1, 1)
        print(z)
        ```
        
        - Multiplying numbers
        
        ```python
        import pytilkit as ptk

        print(z)
        ```
        
        - Divide numbers
        
        ```python
        import pytilkit as ptk
        
        z = ptk.div(1, 1)
        print(z)
        ```
        
        - Area of square
        
        ```python
        import pytilkit as ptk
        
        z = ptk.area.square(5)
        print(z)
        ```
        
        - Area of Rectangle
        
        ```python
        import pytilkit as ptk
        
        z = ptk.area.rect(5, 5)
        print(z)
        ```
        
        - Area of Circle
        
        ```python
        import pytilkit as ptk
        
        z = ptk.area.circ(5)
        print(z)
        ```
        
        -  Area of Triangle 
        
        ```python
        import pytilkit as ptk
        
        z = ptk.area.tri(5, 5, 5)
        print(z)
        ```
        
        >  Jsoned
        
        -  Read Data

        ```
        
        -  Write Data
        
        ```python
        import pytilkit as ptk
        
        data = {"Data": True}
        ptk.write_json("path/to/file.json", data) # Indentation option also available. Indent is 4 by default.
        ```

        ```python
        import pytilkit as ptk
        
        message = "Hello, World!"
        public_pem = """-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
        ... (public key content here) ...
        -----END PUBLIC KEY-----"""
        
        encrypted_message = ptk.encrypt_with_public_key(public_pem, message)
        print("Encrypted message:", encrypted_message)
        ```
        
        -  Decryption with Private Key
        
        ```python
        import pytilkit as ptk
        
        # Generate key pairs
        private_pem, public_pem = ptk.generate_key_pair()
        print("Private Key:\n", private_pem)
        print("Public Key:\n", public_pem)
        
        # Encrypt a message using the public key
        message = "Hello, World!"
        encrypted_message = ptk.encrypt_with_public_key(public_pem, message)
        print("Encrypted message:", encrypted_message)
        
        # Decrypt the encrypted message using the private key
        # Note: In an actual implementation, the private key should be securely input.
        decrypted_message = ptk.decrypt_with_private_key(encrypted_message)
        print("Decrypted message:", decrypted_message)
        ```
