# English Dict

English Dict can be used to find the meaning of words easily.
To find the meaning of an English word by using the `find_word()` function to find the meaning of a word easily. Like
over here:

```
# Replace example with any english word

word =  "example"

find_word(word)

>> example means - : an instance
 (such as a problem to be solved)
 serving to illustrate a rule or
 precept or to act as an exercise
 in the application of a rule
 ```

You can type `c` to clear the terminal if it gets to 
messy.


> **NOTE!**
> 
> Remember that on some ocassions a link may exist but not a certain word like the word `chided`. In this scenario it may
return an alternative word. You could instead use that.
