## A tool for importing Log data from Unity/VRC for Data Processing

This python library is intended to be used with the VRCDataExporter package for unity to receive various formats of data. This tool can then parse the logs and export them as Pandas Dataframes, making it easy to use the data in other data science projects.

This tool is general purpose but is currently being developed by me for use with [Torch2VRC](https://github.com/Rami-Pastrami/Torch2VRC), which of itself is being used for my [VRC-SLT](https://github.com/Rami-Pastrami/VRC_SLT_Docs) project.
This tool is still a bit early, but currently functional for my use cases!
You can install this package with pip from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/VRCDataImporter/).
