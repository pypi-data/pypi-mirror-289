# SPGMI CIQ Python Library

The Python Software Development Kit (SDK) makes REST API integration into your Python environment easier, allowing less technical and experienced Python users to start utilizing REST APIs sooner.

S&P Capital API clients can now access these SDKs to integrate end-of-day and time-series Financial and Market data such as Income Sheet, Balance Sheets, pricing, and dividend information data points from the S&P Capital IQ API into their Python workflows.

 The SDK seamlessly integrates with pandas DataFrames, providing a Jupyter-friendly environment and a simpler, optimized data analysis experience.

## Features

Integrate high-quality data with your systems, portals, and business applications, including:
1. Analysts looking to receive income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow values for backtesting models.
2. Basic automation of desktop/Excel-based modeling when the Excel template reaches its limit.
3. Time-series pricing and market data values as well as dividend information.

## Benefits
1. Output generated in a reusable/extendible object such as a DataFrame, facilitating easy data processing and analysis.
2. Ease of authentication, request, and response handling.
3. Ability to use proxy objects for enhanced network communication.

## Setting up the library
Using the below code, you can make the necessary imports and set up the required instances to use the Python library.

```sh
from IPython.core.display_functions import display
from spgmi_api_sdk.authentication.services import SDKAuthenticateServices
from spgmi_api_sdk.financials.services import SDKFinancialServices
from spgmi_api_sdk.marketdata.services import SDKMarketDataServices

#Required Instances
auth = SDKAuthenticateServices()
fs= SDKFinancialServices()
mds = SDKMarketDataServices()
```
## Authentication Service
These functions provide a seamless authentication process to securely access API services. Included are the methods for obtaining and refreshing access tokens while ensuring all API requests are properly authorized.

### get_token()
```sh
username = "--username--"    #Replace with actual username
password = "--password--"    #Replace with actual password
token_response = auth.get_token(username, password)
bearer_token = token_response.get("access_token")
```
### get_refresh_token()
```sh
refresh_token_response=auth.get_refresh_token("--refresh_token--")
refresh_bearer_token = refresh_token_response.get("access_token")
```
