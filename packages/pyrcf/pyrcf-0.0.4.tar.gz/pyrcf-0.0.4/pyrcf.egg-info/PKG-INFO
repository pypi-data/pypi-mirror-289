A Python Robot Control Framework for quickly prototyping control algorithms for different robot embodiments.

Primarily, this library provides an implementation of a typical control loop (via a `MinimalCtrlLoop` (extended from `SimpleManagedCtrlLoop`) class),
and defines interfaces for the components in a control loop that can be used directly in these control loop implementations. It also provides utility and debugging tools that will be useful for developing controllers and planners for different robots. This package also provides implementations of basic
controllers and planners.

In the long run, this package will also provide implementations of popular motion planners and controllers from literature and using existing libraries.

## Installation

### From pypi

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyrcf.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyrcf)

- `pip install pyrcf`

### From source

- Clone repo and run from inside the directory `pip install .` (recommended to use virtual env) or run `pixi install` (if using [Pixi](https://pixi.sh)).

### Testing Installation

After installation, you should be able to run a robot visualiser script installed globally called `pyrcf-visualise-robot`. Run it with the first
argument as any of the robot descriptions mentioned in the [robot_descriptions.py repo](https://github.com/robot-descriptions/robot_descriptions.py/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#descriptions); e.g. `pyrcf-visualise-robot pepper_description`. This should
start a visualiser in pybullet, where you should be able to move all robot joints and base pose using sliders in the pybullet GUI.

You should also be able to run all the scripts in the `examples` folder.

**More examples and demos will be added soon.**

## PyRCF Philosophy

PyRCF follows the principle of a single thread control loop where components are communicating with each other strictly using pre-defined message types,
and run sequentially.

PyRCF is designed to be a prototyping tool to test different controllers and algorithms in simulation, and **NOT** optimised for real-time control on a real
robot. Although the framework has been tested on real robot interfaces, it is not recommended to do so unless you know what you are doing.

### A generic control loop

```text

LOOP:
  # Read latest robot state
  robot_state = ROBOT_INTERFACE->read_robot_state()

  # Update robot state with estimations (when all states are not directly measurable)
  robot_state = STATE_ESTIMATOR->update_robot_state_estimates(robot_state)

  # Generate global plan (high-level task objective or target)
  global_plan = GLOBAL_PLANNER->generate_global_plan()

  # Generate local plan based on state and global plan
  local_plan = LOCAL_PLANNER->generate_local_plan(robot_state, global_plan)

  # Generate control command based on state and local plan
  cmd = CONTROLLER->compute_commands(robot_state, local_plan)

  # Send command to robot
  ROBOT_INTERFACE->write_robot_command(cmd)

  # Maintain loop frequency (naive implementation)
  SLEEP(period)

END LOOP

```

This package provides interfaces to define custom components (such as controller, robot interface, global planner,
local planner, etc) that can be run in a control loop, as well as provides an implementation of a control loop
class which can execute these components in the required order at the specified rate. Implementations of simple
forms of all components are also available in this package, including simulated interfaces for many robot embodiments.

Custom controllers and planners can be implemented and quickly tested on existing robot interfaces or on custom
robot interfaces (which can be easily defined).

More complex algorithms for control and planning will be provided by this package over time.

Tutorials and more details about concepts will be provided soon in the [tutorials](examples/tutorials) folder.
