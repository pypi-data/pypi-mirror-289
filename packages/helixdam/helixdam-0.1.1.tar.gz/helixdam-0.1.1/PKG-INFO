# HelixDAM Python Wrapper

A Python wrapper for the [Helix DAM API](https://help.perforce.com/helix-core/helix-dam/current/api/#/), providing easy-to-use methods for interacting with digital asset management features.

## Installation

Install the package via pip:

```sh
pip install --update helixdam
```

## Usage

To start using the HelixDAM package, you need to create an instance of the `HelixDAM` class. You can authenticate using either an `account_key` or a combination of `company`, `username`, and `password` (the same as you would enter on the Helix DAM web ui login).

The user account or the account_key should be from a user with Admin permissions on the server, or you will likely get errors on some commands. Feel free to try, though, and leave a comment on what works or what doesn't!

To create an account_key, see [Creating an Account Key](#creating-an-account-key)

```python
from helixdam import HelixDAM

# Authentication with account key
dam = HelixDAM(url='https://your-helixdam-url.com', account_key='your_account_key')

# Authentication with company credentials
dam = HelixDAM(url='https://your-helixdam-url.com', company='company_name', username='user', password='pass')
```

## Methods

### HelixDAM.get_session()

This method is called automatically when using other methods, but can be called manually if you want to verify that the login credentials are valid.

Will raise a HelixDAMAuthException if credentials are not valid.

```python
dam.get_session()
```

### HelixDAM.download_file(depot_file, output_file, changelist)

Downloads a file from the depot

- `depot_path`: In `//depot/stream/depot_path.ext` format
- `output_file` (optional): File path OR File-like object to save the downloaded file contents to. If not specified, the content is returned as bytes.
- `changelist` (optional): Set to download asset as a specific changelist (aka identifier). If not set, will download the latest revision.

Returns file path of output file or file-like object (if specified) or bytes of the downloaded file

```python
dam.download_file(
    depot_path="//depot/some/depot/path.fbx",
    output_file="path_cl_1252.fbx",
    changelist=1252,
)

latest_file_bytes: bytes = dam.download_file(
    depot_path="//depot/some/depot/path.fbx"
)
```

### HelixDAM.download_preview(depot_file, output_file, changelist)

Downloads a preview image of an asset from DAM

(Usage is the same as [download_file](#helixdamdownload_filedepot_file-output_file-changelist) )

### HelixDAM.download_thumbnail(depot_file, output_file, changelist)

Downloads a preview image of an asset from DAM

(Usage is the same as [download_file](#helixdamdownload_filedepot_file-output_file-changelist) )

### HelixDAM.upload_preview(depot_path, input_file, input_bytes, changelist)

Uploads a preview image for an file in DAM. This will automatically trigger Helix Search to generate a thumbnail and submit the thumbnail to your AI Tagging service, if configured.

- depot_path: In `//depot/stream/depot_path.ext` format
- image: May be bytes, base64 string, hex string, or file path
- changelist (optional): Set to upload to asset at a specific changelist (aka identifier) If not set, will upload to the latest revision.

```python
preview_image = Path("img/preview_image.png")

dam.upload_preview(
    depot_path="//depot/stream/my_file.ext",
    image=preview_image,
)
```


### Error Handling

The package includes custom exceptions for handling various errors:

- **HelixDAMException**: General exception for Helix DAM-related errors.
- **HelixDAMAuthException**: Raised for authentication-related issues.

### Testing

To run the test suite, use the following command:

```sh
pytest tests
```

## Extra Info

- As an admin in DAM, click on in the upper right menu and choose `Go to Helix Teamhub`
 - Click on the small arrow in the upper right by your profile image and select `User Preferences`
 - Select API Keys
 - Click `+ Add new key` at the bottom, give it a title, and click save
