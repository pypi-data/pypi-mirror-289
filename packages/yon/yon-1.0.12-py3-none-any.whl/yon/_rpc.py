"""
Remote procedure call support for yon.

Core messages - RpcReq and RpcEvt. Each of it has identification "key", in
format "<fn_code>::<token>". Token is UUID4 string to differentiate which
exact call should receive the result. Token is generated by client.

Rpc works only in network mode (client-server communication).
