MoinMoin - a wiki engine in Python
==================================

MoinMoin is an easy to use, full-featured and extensible wiki software
package written in Python.

It can fulfill a wide range of roles, such as a personal notes organizer
deployed on a laptop or home web server, a company knowledge base deployed
on an intranet, or an Internet server open to individuals sharing the same
interests, goals or projects.


Documentation and Support
=========================

NOTE: moin2 is not released yet.

You will find the latest docs at https://moin-20.readthedocs.io/en/latest.

There is a wiki page collecting all moin2 specific information, links to
support resources and info about MoinMoin development status and plans:
https://moinmo.in/MoinMoin2.0



In general, please make sure that documentation you read on the wiki or
somewhere else on the web is written for the moin version you are using.
Much information you find on the wiki (and elsewhere) will be about
moin 1.9 (and NOT applicable to moin2).


For support, please try the documentation, the homepage, the irc channel
and the mailing list before contacting the MoinMoin authors directly.

If you have trouble with apache (or other webserver) configuration, please
try reading the web server's documentation. Same thing applies for any other
3rd party software usually used with moin, but not written by the MoinMoin
developers.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
