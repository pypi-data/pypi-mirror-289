def jumpToMarker(delta: int, select: bool) -> None:
    """
    Jumps to the marker at the given delta index.

    For example, to jump to the previous marker, use a delta of `-1`.

    ## Args

    * delta (`int`): relative marker index.

    * select (`bool`): whether to select the marker.

def getMarkerName(index: int) -> str:
    """
    Returns the name of the marker at `index`.

    Note that this uses an absolute index, not a relative index.
