Function definitions for managing
[pattern groups](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/playlist.htm#Playlist_picker_panel).

## Examples

Print the names of all patterns in the active pattern group

```py
import patterns

active_group = patterns.getActivePatternGroup()

print(f"Active group: '{patterns.getPatternGroupName(active_group)}'")
print("Entries:")
for pat_idx in patterns.getPatternsInGroup(active_group):
    print("-", patterns.getPatternName(pat_idx))
```
"""


def getActivePatternGroup() -> int:
    """
    Returns the index of the currently-selected pattern group.

    The default "All patterns" grouping has index `-1`. User-defined pattern
    groups have indexes starting from `0`.

    ## Returns

    * `int`: index of the current pattern group.

    Included since API Version 28.

def getPatternGroupCount() -> int:
    """
    Returns the number of user-defined pattern groups.

    The default "All patterns" grouping is not included.

    ## Returns

    * `int`: number of pattern groups.

    """
    Returns the name of the pattern group at index.

    The default "All patterns" group's name cannot be accessed.

    ## Returns

    * `str`: name of pattern group.

    """
    Returns a tuple containing all the patterns in the group at index.
