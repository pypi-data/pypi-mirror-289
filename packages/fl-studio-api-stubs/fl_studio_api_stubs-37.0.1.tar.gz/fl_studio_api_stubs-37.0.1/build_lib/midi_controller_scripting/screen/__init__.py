# Screen

FL Studio built-in module.

Helper functions for controlling the screen of the AKAI FL Studio Fire MIDI
controller.

These likely aren't useful for most scripts, but if you're writing a script for
the Fire they might be handy.

## HELP WANTED

These functions are undocumented. If you know how they work, I'd massively
appreciate a pull request with improvements to the type safety and
documentation.
