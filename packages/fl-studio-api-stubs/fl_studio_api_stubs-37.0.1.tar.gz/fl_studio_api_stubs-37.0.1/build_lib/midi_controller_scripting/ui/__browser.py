def navigateBrowser(direction: int, shiftHeld: bool) -> str:
    """
    Navigates through the browser. `direction` can be 0 for previous

    Shift held will cause the browser item to expand/open  if it's a
    folder/collection ie `Node Type <= -100`, similar to keyboard navigation.

    ## Args

    * `direction` (`int`):
            * `40`: previous item
            * `41`: next item

    * `shiftHeld` (`bool`): whether to expand the selected item if it is a
      folder.

    ## WARNING

    * This doesn't seem to work very reliably, at least on my machine.

    ## Returns

    * `str`: the name of the newly selected item in the browser.
