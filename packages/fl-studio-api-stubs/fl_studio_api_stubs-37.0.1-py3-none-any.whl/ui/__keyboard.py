"""
The keyboard functions within the `ui` module are used for emulating
key-presses within FL Studio. They can be used to perform common
keyboard-related actions such as copying and pasting, and dismissing dialog
boxes.

!!! warning

    In versions of FL Studio before FL Studio 21.0, these functions had the
    capability to interact with applications outside of FL Studio on Windows.

    They now only interact with FL Studio, even if it isn't the active window.
