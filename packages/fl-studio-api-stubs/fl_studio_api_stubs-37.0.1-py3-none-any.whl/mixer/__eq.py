# Mixer / EQ

Functions for interacting with the FL Studio mixer's built-in EQ.
"""


def getEqBandCount() -> int:
    """
    Returns the number of bands in the built-in EQ.

    Whilst this value will always be 3 for current FL Studio versions, it is
    recommended to use this function rather than hard-coding a value to allow
    for better future-proofing.

    * `int`: number of mixer bands

    Returns the gain of the given band on the given track for the built-in EQ.

    Setting `mode=1` will return the gain in decibels rather than as a
    normalized value from `0.0` to `1.0`.

    ## Args

    * `index` (`int`): mixer track index

    * `band` (`int`): EQ band

    * `mode` (`int`, optional): units to return value in. Defaults to `0`.
