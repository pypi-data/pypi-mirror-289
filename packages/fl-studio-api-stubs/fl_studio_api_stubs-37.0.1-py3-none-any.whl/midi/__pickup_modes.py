"""
Many functions within the FL Studio API support a pickup option, meaning that
tweaks to the parameter will only take effect once the value moves past the
current value in the mixer (in both upwards and downwards directions).

By providing a pickup option, scripts can support pickup for these controls.
"""

PIM_None = 0
"""

"""
PIM_AlwaysPickup = 1
"""
Always use pickup, regardless of user's preferences.
"""
PIM_FollowGlobal = 2
"""
