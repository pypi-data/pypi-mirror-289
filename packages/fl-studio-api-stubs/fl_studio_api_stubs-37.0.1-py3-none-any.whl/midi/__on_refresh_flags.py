"""
On refresh flags are passed to the `OnRefresh` callback in order to indicate
what parts of the controller may need to be refreshed.

By checking these flags, controllers can avoid needlessly updating unchanged
parts of their UIs, thus improving performance.

```py
import midi

def OnRefresh(flags: int):
    if flags & midi.HW_Dirty_Mixer_Sel:
        update_mixer_selection_cache()
    if flags & midi.HW_Dirty_LEDs:
        update_led_cache()
    # etc
