"""
These flags can be used alongside [mixer.soloTrack()](https://il-group.github.io/FL-Studio-API-Stubs/midi_controller_scripting/mixer/tracks#mixer.__tracks.soloTrack) to control
the solo state of tracks.

These flags can be combined using bitwise operations.

```py
import mixer, midi

# Solo track one, keeping both source and destination tracks enabled.
mixer.soloTrack(1, midi.fxSoloModeWithSourceTracks | fxSoloModeWithDestTracks)
```
"""

fxSoloModeWithSourceTracks = 1
"""
Solo mixer track, including source tracks routed to it.
"""

fxSoloModeWithDestTracks = 1 << 1
"""
Solo mixer track, including send tracks that it is routed to.
"""

fxSoloModeIgnorePrevious = 1 << 2
"""
Solo only this track, muting all other tracks.
