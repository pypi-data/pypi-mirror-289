# Callbacks

This page documents the callback functions used by the MIDI Controller
Scripting API. Note that these functions cannot be imported, instead, you
should defined the ones that you need within your script's entrypoint file
(`device_*.py`).

## Example entrypoint file

```py
# name=My Script


def OnInit():
    print("FL Studio initialized my script!")
```

## Note on `FlMidiMsg` callbacks

The MIDI Controller Scripting API provides many callback functions for handling
incoming events. If an event isn't handled by an earlier callback, it is passed
to later callbacks.

For simple scripts, these callbacks can be used as an alternative to writing
more complex event handling code. For example, if your script handles control
change (CC) events differently to note events, it may be simpler to write
separate logic for `OnNoteOn`, `OnNoteOff` and `OnControlChange` than it is to
handle all the events in `OnMidiMsg`.

    than once during the lifetime of this Python script.
