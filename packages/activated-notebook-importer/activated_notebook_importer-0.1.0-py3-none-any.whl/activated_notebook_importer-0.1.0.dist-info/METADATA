# ActivatedNotebookImporter

ActivatedNotebookImporter is a Python package developed by Activated AI (https://activated-ai.com) that allows you to import Jupyter notebooks as Python modules. It provides functionality to import notebooks from files or string representations, with support for parameter substitution.

## Installation

You can install ActivatedNotebookImporter using pip:

```
pip install activated-notebook-importer
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use ActivatedNotebookImporter:

```python
from activated_notebook_importer import import_notebook

# Import a notebook from a file
module = import_notebook('path/to/your/notebook.ipynb')

# If your notebook defines a function 'greet', you can now use it:
result = module.greet('World')
print(result)  # Output: Hello, World!

# You can also import a notebook with parameter substitution:
module = import_notebook('path/to/your/notebook.ipynb', {'name': 'Alice'})
```
