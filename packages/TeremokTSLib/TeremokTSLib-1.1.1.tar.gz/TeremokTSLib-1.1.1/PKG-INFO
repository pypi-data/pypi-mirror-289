# What is this Library about?
Easy-to-use (4 lines of code, actually) framework for training powerful predictive models!

# Description
We made a mother-model, which consists of multiple layers of predictive models: ewma is used as trend, Prophet is used for getting seasonality, CatBoost is used for predicting residuals.
Why did we do that? Because we needed a out-of-the-box solution, which could be used by non-ML users.
