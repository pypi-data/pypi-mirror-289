# UCSF ChimeraX Molecular Visualization

This package provides a library that implements many of the algorithms and structural 
manipulations from the ChimeraX molecular visualization and analysis system.  
It does *not* include any of the GUI components, which must be separately licensed.

[ChimeraX](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/) is an application for visualizing and 
analyzing molecule structures such as proteins, RNA, DNA, lipids as well as gene sequences, 
electron microscopy maps, X-ray maps, 3D light microscopy and 3D medical imaging scans.  
It is the successor of the [UCSF Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) program.  

[Example images](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/gallery.html) and [feature highlights](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/features.html) 
show a few of its capabilities, and [recipes](https://rbvi.github.io/chimerax-recipes/) 
show example command and Python API use.
