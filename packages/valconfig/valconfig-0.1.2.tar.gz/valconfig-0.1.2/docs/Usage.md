# Usage

## Basic usage

We suggest organizing a project with the following file layout:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Package install
:sync: package-install
```
BigProject
├── .git/
├── __init__.py
├── main.py
└── config
    ├── __init__.py
    └── defaults.cfg
```
:::

:::{tab-item} Inlined-source install
:sync: source-install
```
BigProject
├── .git/
├── __init__.py
├── main.py
└── config
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── defaults.cfg
    └── valconfig.py
```
:::

::::

Here the `Config` class is defined inside a module `__init__.py`,
so that it can be placed alongside a configuration file and still imported from `config`:

```python
# main.py
from .config import config

...
result = urlopen(config.url) 
```

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Package install
:sync: package-install

```python
# config/__init__.py
from valconfig import ValConfig   # This line changes between package and source install

from pathlib import Path
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import HttpUrl
from scityping.numpy import Array

class Config(ValConfig):
    __default_config_path__ = "defaults.cfg"

    data_source: Optional[Path]
    log_name: Optional[str]
    use_gpu: bool
    url: HttpUrl
    n_units: int
    connectivites: Array[float, 2]  # 2D array of floats

config = Config()
```
:::

:::{tab-item} Inlined-source install
:sync: source-install

```python
# config/__init__.py
from .valconfig import ValConfig   # This line changes between package and source install

from pathlib import Path
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import HttpUrl
from scityping.numpy import Array

class Config(ValConfig):
    __default_config_path__ = "defaults.cfg"

    data_source: Optional[Path]
    log_name: Optional[str]
    use_gpu: bool
    url: HttpUrl
    n_units: int
    connectivites: Array[float, 2]  # 2D array of floats

config = Config()
```
:::

::::

Defaults can be specified directly in the `Config` class, but when possible it
is recommended to specify them in a separate config file, which in this example
we named `defaults.cfg`. It might look something like the following

```
# defaults.cfg
[DEFAULTS]

data_source   = <None>
log_name      = <None>
use_gpu       = False
n_units       = 3
connectivites = [[.3, -.3,  .1],
                 [.1,  .1, -.2],
                 [.8,   0, -.2]]
url           = http://example.com
```

The path to this file is specified by defining the class variable `__default_config_path__`. When this variable is undefined or `None`,
`Valconfig` presumes that no such file exists.

:::{Important}
Your `Config` class should be instantiable without arguments, as
`Config()`. This means that all parameters should have defaults, either in
the class itself, or in a defaults file.
:::


Finally, it is often convenient to have `config` available at the top level
of the package. For this we add an import to the root `__init__.py` file.

```python
# __init__.py
from .config import config
```

## Updating config values

Because we make `Config` a singleton, the following are two completely equivalent
ways of updating field values.

::::{grid} 2

:::{grid-item-card} By assignment
```python
# main.py
from .config import config  # instance
config.use_gpu = True
```
:::

:::{grid-item-card} By keyword
```python
# main.py
from .config import Config  # class
Config(use_gpu=True)
```
::::

The keyword form can be useful when updating values programmatically.
That said, if you find yourself updating the config programmatically, consider
whether it might not be better to move that logic to a [validator] method
of the `Config`

## User-specific local configuration

In the example above, `data_source`, `use_gpu` and `log_name` are fields that
may be user- or machine-specific. Suppose for example that two people, Jane
and Mary, are using the `BigProject` code in different contexts. Both develop
using their own laptops, but Jane’s project is more data heavy, so she tends to
run her analyses on a bigger workstation. The local configuration on each
machine therefore needs to be slightly different. We can accommodate this by
adding local config files:

::::{card-carousel} 2

:::{card} (Jane, laptop)

```
# local.cfg
[DEFAULTS]
log_name    = Jane
use_gpu     = False
data_source = /home/Jane/project-data
```
:::

:::{card} (Jane, workstation)
```
# local.cfg
[DEFAULTS]
log_name    = Jane
use_gpu     = True
data_source = /shared-data/BigProject
```
:::

:::{card} (Mary, laptop)
```
# local.cfg
[DEFAULTS]
log_name    = Mary
use_gpu     = False
data_source = D:\project-data
```
:::

::::

We correspondingly add `local.cfg` to the file layout and the `Config` definition:

::::{grid} 1 1 2 2

:::{grid-item-card} File layout
:columns: auto
```
BigProject
├── .git/
├── __init__.py
├── local.cfg
├── main.py
└── config
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── defaults.cfg
    └── valconfig.py
```
:::

:::{grid-item-card} `Config definition`
:columns: auto

```python
# config/__init__.py
from valconfig import ValConfig

from pathlib import Path
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import HttpUrl
from scityping.numpy import Array

class Config(ValConfig):
    __default_config_path__ = "defaults.cfg"
    __local_config_filename__ = "local.cfg"

    data_source: Optional[Path]
    log_name: Optional[str]
    use_gpu: bool
    url: HttpUrl
    n_units: int
    connectivites: Array[float, 2]

config = Config()
```
:::

::::

When `Config` instantiates, it does the following:

1. Parse the file at the location pointed to by `__default_config_path__` and
   instantiate the `config` instance.
2. Search the current directory for a file matching `__local_config_filename__`.  
   If one is found, it is parsed and `config` updated.
3. Move up the directory tree and search again for a file matching `__local_config_filename__`.  
   `ValConfig` will continue moving up the directory tree until it hits the root directory.[^multiple-local-configs]

 In our example, to find `local.cfg`, the project would need to be executed from
 within `BigProject` or one of its subdirectories.

:::{hint} We can think of repositories as being used either as a “project” or
a “library” – where library repositories are *imported* by projects. 
Typically a user-local config file is useful for project repositories.
:::


[^multiple-local-configs]: In fact, the search up the directory tree continues
  until we hit the root directory. Then all the found config files are parsed
  in *reversed* order, and the `config` instance updated with each. This allows
  a master file to define defaults, with more specific config files for
  subprojects. We expect however, that in most cases a single local config
  file to be enough.

## Special value substitutions

Config files are typically parsed as text, which leaves it up to the `Config`
class to define validators which correctly interpret those values. To avoid
having to write custom validators for some common cases, the following special
values are provided:

- `<None>`: Converted to `None`.
- `<default>`: Use the default defined in the `BaseModel`. Can be used to
  unset an option from another config file.

To add your own substitutions, update the dictionary `__value_subsitutions__`
in your `Config` subclass.

## Relative path resolution

When a value, after validation, is an instance of {py:class}`~python:pathlib.Path`, then it is resolved with the following rules:
- If the path is absolute (i.e. it starts with `/`), it is not changed.
- If the path is relative, it is prepended with the directory in which it was defined.
  For example, if the file `~/my-projects/projectA/local.cfg` defines the path
  ```
  "../data/"
  ```
  it will be resolved to
  ```
  "~/my-projects/data/"
  ```
- For paths default in a defaults file, the logic is more delicate.
  The gist is that input paths are relative to the default config file,
  while output paths are relative to the *current directory*.
  For details on how we differentiate between input and output path,
  see "More on path resolution" below.

:::{dropdown} More on path resolution
There are different contexts for a relative path specified in a
config file, each with a different "obvious" resolution.
The path resolution logic is contained in the function `ValConfig.resolve_path`,
which considers the following situations:

- Absolute paths are never modified.
- Relative paths specified in a user-local config file should always be
  relative to that config file.
- Relative *input* paths specified in a default config file should be
  relative to that config file. For example, a matplotlib style file
  might be packaged with the default config.
- Relative *output* paths specified in a default config file should be
  relative to the *current directory*.
  For example, a path for storing produced figures. This should definitely
  not be relative to the default config file, which will likely be buried
  under some external package (very possibly under a `site-packages` 
  the user will never look into.)

We use two heuristics to differentiate between cases, which should be
reliable unless users intentionally break their assumptions:

- If the `root/path` concatenation exists => Assume an input path.
  (Broken if a file or directory is added to this location manually.)
- SPECIAL CASE: If `path` is simply "." and the current root is the
  default config => Always resolve relative to current directory,
  independent of whether it is an input or output path.
  (I.e. assume an output path.)

## Config class options

The behaviour of a `ValConfig` subclass can be customized by setting class
variables. Three have already introduced: `__default_config_path__`, 
`__local_config_filename__`, `__value_substitutions__`. The full list is as follows:

`__default_config_path__`
: Path to the config file containing defaults.
  Path is relative to the directory defining the `Config` class (in our example,
  path is relative to *config/*)

`__local_config_filename__`
: Filename to search for local configuration. If `None`, no search is performed.
  Typically this is set to `None` for library packages and a string value
  for project packages: library packages are best configured by
  modifying their `config` object (perhaps within a project’s own `config`),
  than by using a local file.
  If no file is found, and `__create_template_config__` is `True` (the default),
  then a blank config file with instructions is created at the root of the project repository.
  Default value is `None`. 

`__value_substitutions__`
: Dictionary of substitutions for plain text values.
  Substitutions are applied before other validators, so they can be used to
  convert invalid values to valid ones, or to avoid interpreting the value
  as a string.

`__create_template_config__`
: Whether a template config file should be created in a standard location when
  no local config file is found. This has no effect when `__local_config_filename__`
  is `None`.
  The default is `True`, which is equivalent to letting `__local_config_filename__`
  determine whether to create a template config. In almost all cases this default
  should suffice.
  Typically this is set to `False` for utility
  packages, and `True` for project packages.


`__interpolation__`
: Passed as argument to {py:class}`~python:configparser.ConfigParser`.
  Default is {py:class}`~python:configparser.ExtendedInterpolation`.
  (Note that, as with {py:class}`~python:configparser.ConfigParser`, an *instance* must be passed.)

`__empty_lines_in_values__`
: Passed as argument to `ConfigParser`.
  Default is `True`: this prevents multiline values with empty lines, but
  makes it much easier to indent without accidentally concatenating values.

`__top_message_default__`
: The instruction message added to the top of a
  template config file when it is created.

## Advanced usage: adding logic with validators

Since a `Config` class is a normal class, you can all the usual Python functionality
to add arbitrary logic, like overriding `__init__` or adding computed fields
via properties:

```python
from valconfig import ValConfig

class Config(ValConfig):
  data_source: Optional[Path]
  log_name: Optional[str]
  use_gpu: bool

  def __init__(self, **kwds):
    kwds["use_gpu"] = False   # Modify `kwds` before fields are assigned
    super().__init__(**kwds)  # <-- Fields are assigned & validators are run here
    self.use_gpu = False      # Modify fields after they have been assigned

  @property
  def log_header(self):
    return f"{self.logname} ({self.data_source})"
```

However there should be little use in overriding `__init__`, since `ValConfig`
provides *validators* which can be used to assign arbitrary logic to a field:

```python
import torch
from pydantic import validator
from valconfig import ValConfig

class Config(ValConfig):
  use_gpu: bool

  @validator("use_gpu")
  def check_gpu(cls, v):
    if v and not torch.has_cuda:
      print("Cannot use GPU: torch reports CUDA is not available.")
      v = False
    return v
```

By default, custom validators are run after a value has been cast to the
prescribed type. To run a validator before type casting, add the `pre` keyword:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from valconfig import ValConfig

class Config(ValConfig):
  data_source: Optional[Path]

  @validator("data_source", pre=True):
  def default_source(cls, src):
    if src is None:
      src = "../data"  # Because we use pre=True, we don’t need to cast to Path
    return src
  ```

There is a lot more one can do with validators, as detailed in [Pydantic’s documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/validators/).
