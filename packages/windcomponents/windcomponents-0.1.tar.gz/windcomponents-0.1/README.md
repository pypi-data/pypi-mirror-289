# windcomponents

py lib for rwy crosswind and tailwind calculations
programmed for analysis with metar data
works with 10 deg wind intervals
work in progress
consider rwy = magnetic, metar is true, so apply magnetic variation/inclination etc
Not yet optimised for runtime performance (duplication of calculation only required once - should become a dedicated function)
status: very conceptual
