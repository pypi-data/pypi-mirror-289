        Further redistribution of the geographic data bundled with this package must

        Simply using this library to lookup data from pycountry does not produce
        outputs that directly copy or modify the original licensed geographic data.
        Thus, using the library to find pycountry data should not constitute a

geosub v0.1.1a0
---------------

Docs: https://geosub.readthedocs.io/

Lookup ISO 3166-2 geographic subdivisions from postal and country codes, using GeoNames and pycountry.

Adapted from a very similar library for looking up timezones: https://github.com/dmayo3/geotz

Motivation
----------

1. Easy to use. No API key or external API service required.

2. Fast offline lookup.

3. No downloads required; the necessary data comes bundled with the package.

4. No network requests.

5. I tried to keep the extra dependencies to a minimum. Only pycountry is required.

6. Data is loaded from disk on demand, so as to not use unnecessary memory.

Development
-----------

To run the build, there's the GitHub actions workflows as well as the option to run locally.

For running the build locally, use `pip install tox` and the run `tox` in the repository base
directory (or `tox -p` to run the build in parallel).

1. Ensure you have `tox` installed e.g. by running `pip install tox`

2. Extract data `tox -e extract_data`

3. Run the build: `tox`
