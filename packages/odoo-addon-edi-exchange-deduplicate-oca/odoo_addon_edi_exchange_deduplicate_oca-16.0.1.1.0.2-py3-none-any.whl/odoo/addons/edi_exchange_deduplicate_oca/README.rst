Configuration
=============

Go to "EDI -> Config -> Exchange Type".

Enable "Deduplicate on Send" option -> Enable "Delete obsolete records" option.

Usage
=====

  - "block_obsolescence" is an technical option on records to avoid marking them as obsolete.

With all the types that have been enabled "Delete obsolete records" option, the cron will remove their obsolete records.
  - If the records are obsolete, delete them even if their type's flag has been disabled.
