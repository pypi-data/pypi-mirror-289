# Kahi ranking udea works plugin 
Kahi will use this plugin to insert or update the works information from ranking office file from University of Antioquia.

# Description
Plugin that read the information from a file with papers published and reported to the ranking office at University of Antioquia to update or insert the information of the research products in CoLav's database format.

# Installation
You could download the repository from github. Go into the folder where the setup.py is located and run
```shell
pip3 install .
```
From the package you can install by running
```shell
pip3 install Kahi_openalex_subjects
```
# Similarity support
To process works without doi, similarity is mandaroty. Then a elastic search server must be running. The plugin will use the server to find the most similar works in the database. To deply it please read https://github.com/colav/Chia/tree/main/elasticsaerch and follow the instructions.

Docker and docker-compose are required to deploy the server.

if you only wants to process works with doi, you can skip this step and remove the es_index, es_url, es_user and es_password from the yaml file.

**But it is mandatory to put `ranking_udea_works/doi` in the yaml file.**


# Usage
To use this plugin you must have kahi installed in your system and construct a yaml file such as
```yaml
config:
  database_url: localhost:27017
  database_name: kahi
  log_database: kahi
  log_collection: log
workflow:
  ranking_udea_works/doi:
    es_index: kahi_es
    es_url: http://localhost:9200
    es_user: elastic
    es_password: colav
    file_path: udea/produccion 2018-2022 al 27 oct 2022.xlsx
