CHERAB for Inversion, which is a package for the inversion technique of SVD, MFR, etc.
For more information, see the [documentation pages](https://cherab-inversion.readthedocs.io/).

Quick Start
-----------
You can quickly try the inversion technique with `Pixi` tool:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/munechika-koyo/cherab_inversion
cd cherab_inversion
pixi run lab
```
Then, JupyterLab will be launched and you can try the inversion technique with the example notebook.
