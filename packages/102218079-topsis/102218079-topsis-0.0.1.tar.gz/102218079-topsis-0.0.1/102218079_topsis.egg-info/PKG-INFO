TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a decision-making method that helps identify the most suitable alternative by evaluating how close each option is to the ideal solution and how far it is from the worst-case scenario. The process involves normalizing the decision matrix to standardize performance measures, applying weights to reflect the importance of different criteria, and calculating distances from the ideal and negative-ideal solutions. By determining the relative closeness of each alternative to the ideal solution, TOPSIS provides a straightforward way to rank options and make informed decisions based on multiple criteria.
