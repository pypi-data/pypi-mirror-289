# sopel-factoriomods

A Sopel plugin to show information about linked Factorio mods.

Uses the [Factorio Mod Portal API](https://wiki.factorio.com/Mod_portal_API),
which is *probably* stable but you never know. Proceed cautiously.

## Installing

Releases are hosted on PyPI, so after installing Sopel, all you need is `pip`:
