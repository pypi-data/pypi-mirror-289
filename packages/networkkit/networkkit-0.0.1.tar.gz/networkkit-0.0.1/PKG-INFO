                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# NetworkKit

NetworkKit is a simple yet powerful communication framework designed to streamline the interaction between distributed agents. Originally built for AI agent swarms, NetworkKit leverages both publish/subscribe (pub/sub) and HTTP protocols to enable seamless and scalable message exchange across diverse systems. Whether you are building a network of IoT devices, a microservices architecture, or orchestrating interactions within AI agent swarms, NetworkKit provides the necessary tools and abstractions to ensure reliable and efficient communication.

## Features

- **Message Handling**: Define and manage various message types and content, including support for multiple message categories such as chat, system updates, and sensor data.
- **ZeroMQ Integration**: Efficiently publish and subscribe to messages using ZeroMQ, enabling high-performance asynchronous communication.
- **HTTP Integration**: Send and receive messages via HTTP using FastAPI, providing flexibility for web-based communication.
- **Pydantic Models**: Leverage Pydantic for robust data validation and serialization, ensuring data integrity and ease of use.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Support for asynchronous message handling, allowing non-blocking operations and improved performance in distributed systems.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily extend the framework to support additional protocols or custom message handling logic.

## Installation

To install NetworkKit, use pip to install the package:

```bash
pip install networkkit
```

## Usage

### Message Data Structures

The `messages.py` module defines the message data structures used for communication within the NetworkKit framework.

#### Message

The `Message` class is a Pydantic model representing a message object exchanged through the data bus. It provides a structured way to define and validate the content of messages, ensuring consistency and reliability in communication.

Attributes:
- `source` (str): The source of the message (e.g., agent name, sensor name).
- `to` (str): The intended recipient of the message (e.g., agent name, or 'ALL' for broadcast).
- `content` (str): The actual message content in string format.
- `created_at` (str, optional): The timestamp of when the message was created. If not provided, it will be automatically set to the current time by the databus.
- `message_type` (MessageType): The type of message as defined by the `MessageType` enumeration.

Example:
```python
from networkkit.messages import Message, MessageType

message = Message(
    source="Agent1",
    to="Agent2",
    content="Hello, Agent2!",
    message_type=MessageType.CHAT
)
```

#### MessageType

An enumeration class representing the different message types used in NetworkKit:

- `HELO`: Indicates a login request or checking if the agent “to” is available.
- `ACK`: Response to a HELO request, indicating the agent is available.
- `CHAT`: Text message intended for conversation.
- `SYSTEM`: System message coming from the data hub.
- `SENSOR`: Messages for data coming from sensors.
- `ERROR`: Error messages.
- `INFO`: A communication for agents on any non conversational or sensor data.

### Network Module

The `network.py` module provides interfaces and implementations for message sending and receiving.

#### Subscriber Protocol

Defines the interface for subscribers to the bus that can recieve and handle Messages. Subscribers must implement the following methods:

- `handle_message(self, message: Message) -> Any`: Asynchronous method for handling received messages.
- `is_intended_for_me(self, message: Message) -> bool`: Method to determine if a message is intended for this subscriber.

#### MessageSender Protocol

Defines the interface for senders that send messages over the network. Implementations must provide the following method:

- `send_message(self, message: Message) -> Any`: Method to send a message over the network.

#### ZMQMessageReceiver

Class to receive messages using ZeroMQ and distribute them to registered subscribers. Implementors of the Suscriber protocol can register to subscribe to this receiver. It establishes a ZeroMQ subscriber socket, listens for messages, and distributes them to registered subscribers based on their `is_intended_for_me` method.

#### HTTPMessageSender

Class to send messages over HTTP using the `requests` library. It sends messages as JSON payloads to a specified HTTP endpoint.

### Data Bus

The `databus.py` module provides a data bus service for publishing messages using ZeroMQ and a FastAPI interface (HTTP) for receiving messages. Incoming Messages via the HTTP endpoint will be published via the ZeroMQ for subscribers to pick up.

#### Running the Data Bus

1. Execute the script from the console:

```bash
python -m networkkit.databus
```

This will start the FastAPI server and the ZeroMQ publisher.


## Example Code

Here is an example of how to use NetworkKit to send and receive messages:
```python
from networkkit.messages import Message, MessageType
from networkkit.network import ZMQMessageReceiver, HTTPMessageSender

# Example message
message = Message(
    source="Agent1",
    to="Agent2",
    content="Hello, Agent2!",
    message_type=MessageType.CHAT
)

# Sending a message over HTTP
sender = HTTPMessageSender(publish_address="http://127.0.0.1:8000")
response = sender.send_message(message)
print(response.status_code)

# Receiving messages with ZMQ
receiver = ZMQMessageReceiver(subscribe_address="tcp://127.0.0.1:5555")

class MySubscriber:
    name = "Agent2"

    async def handle_message(self, message: Message):
        print(f"Received message: {message.content}")

    def is_intended_for_me(self, message: Message) -> bool:
        return message.to == self.name or message.to == "ALL"

receiver.register_subscriber(MySubscriber())
asyncio.run(receiver.start())
```
