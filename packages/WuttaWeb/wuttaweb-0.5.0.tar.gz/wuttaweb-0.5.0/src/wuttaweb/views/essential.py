Essential views for convenient includes

Most apps should include this module::

   pyramid_config.include('wuttaweb.views.essential')

That will in turn include the following modules:

* :mod:`wuttaweb.views.auth`
* :mod:`wuttaweb.views.common`
"""


def defaults(config, **kwargs):
    mod = lambda spec: kwargs.get(spec, spec)

    config.include(mod('wuttaweb.views.auth'))
    config.include(mod('wuttaweb.views.common'))
    config.include(mod('wuttaweb.views.settings'))


def includeme(config):
    defaults(config)
