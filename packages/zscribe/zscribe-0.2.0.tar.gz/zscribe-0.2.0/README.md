## Usage

ZScribe is designed to work automatically through git hooks, but also provides options for manual usage via the command-line interface.

### Automatic Usage with Git Hooks

Once installed and configured, ZScribe can automatically generate commit messages and pull request descriptions using git hooks.

To set up the git hooks:

```bash
zscribe hooks install --type both --model <your-chosen-model>
```

This will install both commit and pull request hooks, using the specified model for both.

After installation, ZScribe will automatically:
- Generate a commit message when you make a commit (you can edit this message before finalizing the commit)
- Generate a pull request description when you create a new pull request

### Manual Usage

While git hooks provide automatic functionality, you can also use ZScribe manually:

1. Generate a commit message:
   ```bash
   zscribe commit <commit1> <commit2> [--refine]
   ```

2. Generate a pull request description:
   ```bash
   zscribe pr <pr_number>
   ```

3. List available models:
   ```bash
   zscribe models
   ```

> **Note**: For manual invocations, you can use the `ZSCRIBE_MODEL` environment variable to specify the model:
> ```bash
> export ZSCRIBE_MODEL='gpt-4'
> zscribe commit HEAD~1 HEAD
> ```

### Managing Models

It's important to note that the model used by git hooks is separate from the one used for manual invocations. 

- To update the model used by git hooks:
  ```bash
  zscribe hooks update --type {commit|pr|both} --model <new-model>
  ```

- The `ZSCRIBE_MODEL` environment variable is only used for manual invocations and does not affect git hooks.

Always use the command-line interface to update the model for hooks. The `ZSCRIBE_MODEL` environment variable does not affect the model used by git hooks.

## Examples

1. Install git hooks with a specific model:
   ```bash
   zscribe hooks install --type both --model gpt-4
   ```

2. Update the model for the commit hook:
   ```bash
   zscribe hooks update --type commit --model claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
   ```

3. Manually generate a commit message for the last commit:
   ```bash
   zscribe commit HEAD~1 HEAD
   ```

4. Manually generate a pull request description for PR #42:
   ```bash
   zscribe pr 42
   ```

5. List all available models:
   ```bash
   zscribe models
   ```

6. Manually generate a commit message using a specific model (does not affect git hooks):
   ```bash
   ZSCRIBE_MODEL=gpt-4 zscribe commit HEAD~1 HEAD
   ```
