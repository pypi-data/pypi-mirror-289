# Some validation for charges are tricky:
# 1. Tool usage, all good we have a policy method containing the project
# 2. Staff charge, all good we can use check_billing_to_project directly
# 3. Area access record is not possible because we don't have the project
# 4. Training we don't have the project either
# 5. Consumables we don't know if those charges are from post usage or not. Either way we cannot separate at the moment
# 6. Custom charges we can use check_billing_to_project
# 7. Missed reservation cannot be dissociated from tool usage or area access
# Bonus: we are also preventing reservation on tool and areas if those are not enabled

# Decided to use signals in models.py to prevent any charge not authorized by the fund
