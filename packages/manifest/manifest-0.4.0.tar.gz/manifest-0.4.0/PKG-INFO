# Manifest ✨

```
man·i·fest [verb]

: to make something happen by imagining it and consciously thinking that it will happen
```

Want to use an LLM in your code without writing prompts or setting up an
LLM client? Manifest makes it as easy as writing a function that describes what
you want.

# Examples

## Sentiment analysis

Classify some text as positive or not.

```python
from manifest import ai

@ai
def is_optimistic(text: str) -> bool:
    """ Determines if the text is optimistic"""

assert is_optimistic("This is amazing!")
```

## Translation

Translate text from one language to another.

```python
from manifest import ai

@ai
def translate(english_text: str, target_lang: str) -> str:
    """ Translates text from english into a target language """

assert translate("Hello", "fr") == "Bonjour"
```

## Image analysis

Analyze images by passing in a Path to a file.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from manifest import ai

@ai
def breed_of_dog(image: Path) -> str:
    """Determines the breed of dog from a photo"""

image = Path("path/to/dog.jpg")
print(breed_of_dog(image))
```

## Complex objects

For advanced uses, you can return complex data structures.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from manifest import ai

@dataclass
class Actor:
    name: str
    character: str

@dataclass
class Movie:
    title: str
    director: str
    year: int
    top_cast: list[Actor]

@ai
def similar_movie(movie: str, before_year: int | None=None) -> Movie:
    """Discovers a similar movie, before a certain year, if the year is
    provided."""

like_inception = similar_movie("Inception")
print(like_inception)

```

# Installation

```
pip install manifest
```

# How does it work?

Manifest relies heavily on runtime metadata, such as a function's name,
docstring, arguments, and type hints. It uses all of these to compose a prompt
behind the scenes, then sends the prompt to an LLM. The LLM "executes" the
prompt, and returns a json-based format that we can safely parse back into the
appropriate object.

To get the most out the `@ai` decorator:

- Name your function well.
- Add type hints to your function.
- Add a high-value docstring to your function.

# Limitations

## REPL

Manifest doesn't work from the REPL, due to it needing access to the source code
of the functions it decorates.

## Types

You can only pass in and return the following types:

- Dataclasses
- `Enum` subclasses
- primitives (str, int, bool, None, etc)
- basic container types (list, dict, tuple)
- unions
- Any combination of the above

## Prompts

The prompt templates are also a little fiddly sometimes. They can be improved.

# Initialization

To make things super simple, manifest uses ambient LLM credentials, currently
just `OPENAI_API_KEY`. If environment credentials are not found, you will be
instructed to initialize the library yourself.
