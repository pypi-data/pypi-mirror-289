Motivation
------------

Pydoctest helps you verify that your docstrings match your function signatures.
As a codebase evolves, you can some times forget to update the docstrings.


Installation
-----------

Install pydoctest with pip:

    $ python3 -m pip install pydoctest

Usage
-----------
Navigate to your project location, and execute pydoctest

    $ pydoctest

With no pydoctest.json configuration file, it will by default validate all .py files recursively in the current directory (`**/*.py`). See the configuration section for options.
If you get errors with modules not being found, try placing the pydoctest.json differently or executing inside the package.

Output
----------
Pydoctest supports outputting results either as `JSON` or `Text` with different verbosity options. By default, `Text` is returned. To specify the output, invoke with `--reporter` argument:

    $ pydoctest --reporter [json | text]

For Text-output, `--verbosity` can be provided with a value of 0 (quiet), 1 (show failed) or 2 (show all).

    $ pydoctest --reporter text --verbosity 1
Configuration
-----------
Pydoctest can be configured with a config JSON file. By default, it will search for `pydoctest.json` in the directory pydoctest is executed. A path can also be provided when executing:

    $ pydoctest --config /path/to/pydoctest.json

Example pydoctest.json:

```json
{
    "include_paths": [ "server/*.py" ],
    "fail_on_missing_docstring": true,
    "parser": "google",
}
```

Docstring format can be specified with the `--parser` argument:

    $ pydoctest --parser google

Currently, only google, numpy and sphinx are supported.

Full list of configuration options:
- "include_paths": [ List of strings ]  # Patterns to search modules with. Defaults to `[**/*.py]`
- "exclude_paths": [ List of strings ]  # Patterns to exclude modules with. Defaults to `["**/__init__.py", "**/setup.py"]`
- "verbosity": [ 0 | 1 | 2 ]  # How much to print, 0 = quiet, 1 = show failed, 2 = show all.
- "parser": [ "google" (default) | "sphinx" | "numpy" ]  # Docstring format to use. Please raise an issue if you need other formats implemented.
- "fail_on_missing_docstring": [ true | false (default) ]  # Mark a function as failed, if it does not have a docstring.
- "fail_on_missing_summary": [ true | false (default) ]  # Mark a function as failed, if it does have a docstring, but no summary.
- "fail_on_raises_section": [ true (default) | false ]  # Mark a function as failed, if docstring doesn't mention raised exceptions correctly.
- "exclude_classes": [ List of strings ] # Patterns to exclude classes with, e.g. `["Test*]"`
- "exclude_methods": [ List of strings ] # Patterns to exclude class methods with, e.g. for private methods you would use `["__*]"`
- "exclude_functions": [ List of strings ] # Patterns to exclude functions with, e.g. for private methods you would use `["__*]"`

CLI
------------
Printing the help message shows all currently implemented cli options.
```
pydoctest --help
```

Example
-------
```
# example_file.py
def func_type_mismatch(self, a: int) -> int:
    """[summary]

    Args:
        a (float): [description]        <-- float is not int

    Returns:
        int: [description]
    """
    pass

# /example_file.py::func_type_mismatch FAIL | Argument type differ. Argument 'a' was expected (from signature) to have type '<class 'int'>', but has (in docs) type '<class 'float'>'
Tested 1 function(s) across 1 module(s).
Succeeded: 0, Failed: 1, Skipped: 0
```

Editor support
-------
Currently `pydoctest` is supported by `vscode`: https://github.com/jepperaskdk/vscode-pydoctest
