    If this is not used on a model field/attribute, the field will get the default set of
    options automatically if the field has a type-hint; see topic
    [BaseModel Fields](./#model-fields).

    Preferred way going forward to provide additional options/configuration to BaseModel fields.

    If you don't specify a value for a particular attribute, it will have the
    `xsentinels.default.Default` value. When a Default value is encountered while constructing a
    `xmodel.base.model.BaseModel`, it will resolve these Default values and assign the final
    value for the field.

    To resolve these Defaults, it will look at field on the parent BaseModel class.
    If a non-Default value is defined there, it will use that for the child.
    If not, then it looks at the next parent. If no non-Default value is found we then use
    a value that makes sense. You can see what this is in the first line of each doc-comment.
    In the future, when we start using Python 3.9 we can use type annotations (typing.Annotated)
    to annotate a specific value to the Default type generically. For now it's hard-coded.

    ## Side Notes

    Keep in mind that after the `.api` is accessed for the first time on a particular model
    class, the sdk will construct the rest of the class (lazily)...
    it will read and then remove/delete from the BaseModel class any type-hinted json fields
    with a Field object assigned to the class. It moves these Field objects into a special
    internal structure.  The class gets `None` values set on all fields after this is done.

    ## Details on why we remove them:

    Doing this helps with __getattr__, as it will still be executed for fields without a value
    when we create an object instance. __getattr__ is used to support lazy lookups [via API] of
    related objects. Using __getattr__ is much faster than using the __getattribute__ version.
    So I want to keep using the __getattr__ version if possible.

        Resolves all dataclass attributes/fields on self that are still set to `Default`.
        The only exception is `type_hint`. We will always use what is passed in, regardless
        of if there is a parent-field with one set. This allows one on a BaseModel to easily
        override the type-hint without having to create a field with an explicitly set
        type_hint set on it (ie: let normal python annotated type-hint override any parent type).

        This includes ones on subclasses [dataclass will generically tell us about all of them].
        System calls this when a BaseModel class is being lazily constructed
        [ie: when gets the `xmodel.base.model.BaseModel.api` attribute for the first time or
        attempts to create an instance of the BaseModel for the fist time].

        When the BaseModel class is being constructed, this method is called to resolve all
        the Default values still on the instance. We do this by:

        1. We first look at parent_field object if one has been given.
            - If ask that parent field which options where explicitly set by user and which
                ones were set by resolving a `xsentinels.default.Default`. Field objects have an
                internal/private var that keeps track of this.
        2. Next, figure out standard default value for option if option's current value is
            current at `xsentinels.default.Default` (a default sentential value, used to detect
            which values were left unset by user).


        ## More Details

        I have Field objects keep track of which fields were not at
        Default when they are resolved. This allows child Field objects
        to know which values to copy into themselves and which ones
        should be resolved normally via Default.

        The goal here is to avoid copying value from Parent that
        were originally resolved via Default mechanism
        (and were not set explicitly by user).

        An example of why this is handy:

        If we have a parent model with a field of a different type vs the one on the child.
        Unless the converter was explicitly set by the user we want to just use the default
        converter for the different type on the child (and not use the wrong converter by default).
