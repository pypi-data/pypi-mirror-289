## API Class Overview
[api-class-overview]: #api-class-overview

This modules houses the `BaseApi` class, meant to bridge between the Client
(which executes requests) and the `xmodel.model.BaseModel` classes.

In order to reduce any name-collisions for other normal Model attributes, everything
related to the Api that the `xmodel.model.BaseModel` needs is gotten though via the
`BaseApi` class.

You can get the Api instance related to the model via `xmodel.model.BaseModel.api`.

>>> obj = BaseModel.api.get_via_id(1)

You can send a single object with any changes you make to the model attributes to API via:

>>> obj.api.send()

The `BaseApi` instance will be different based on how you access the api, either via the model
class or model instance.  That way the `BaseApi` instance you use will know the model it's
related too.  Also, the `BaseApi` can keep track of internal state. An example of this is
keeping track of the last error encounted for that model object (vs other model instances).

Some `BaseApi` methods require an associated model object
(examples: `BaseApi`.delete` and `BaseApi`.model`).
Calling methods that require a model using an Api object that does not have one will raise
an error.

This class is a sort of "Central Hub" that ties all intrested parties together.

### Use of type-hints for changing used type
[type-hints]: #type-hints

Based on the type-hint, `BaseApi` will create/use these types for the core classes that implment
most of the logic/settings.

- `BaseApi`.structure`: The structure of the Model/Api, which are the fields, url's and other
    options that control how it behaves with the Api service.
    This also determin the Field type to use via a Generic type-hint.

        >>> structure: MyStructure[M, MyField]

    In this case, `MyStructure` will be used and `MyStructure` will allocate
    `MyField` by default when creating field defintions from type-hints on Model attributes.

    `M` here informs the IDE of the Model type MyStructure will be used with when,
    this helps with type-completion.

    See `BaseApi`.structure` for more details.

- `BaseApi`.client`: This is code that does the work of sending requests and reciveing responses
    with the Api service for the Api/Model. The type-hint set here is allocated once-per
    `xmodel.model.BaseModel` class, which means once per-`xmodel.base.structure.Structure`
    instance.

- `BaseApi`.settings`: Basic environmental settings (ie: API token, base-url, etc)

- `BaseApi`.auth`: Manages getting any needed authorization and caching the tokens.
    The system will use the type-hint provided and treat it as a `xinject.resource.Dependency`.
    This allows the auth/token to be shared amoung various Model Api objects.

A sub-class of Api can (if desired) specify to use different client/config types by simply
declaring a type-annotation about it. Subclases inherit the type-hints from the super-class
like you would expect. The Api object when created will use the type-hints to allocate
the proper class. In this way, the type-hints act as a sort of 'template' and also inform
IDE's about what type the objects are.  Sort of a two-for-one deal!

Here is an example of how to customize/define/configure each part of the system:

>>>import xmodel.base.auth
>>>import xmodel
>>>
>>> # TODO: This example is WAY out of date, normalize with the modern `xsettings` lib.
>>> class MySettings(xmodel_test.base.settings.RestSettings):
...     my_custom_var: str = settings.ConfigVar("CUSTOM_ENV_VAR", "default")
>>>
>>> class MyAuth(auth.RelationAuth):
...     pass
>>>
>>> class MyClient(xmodel.BaseClient):
...     pass
>>>
>>> class MyField(xmodel.Field):
...     pass
>>>
>>> class MyStructure(xmodel.BaseStructure):
...     pass
>>>
>>> class MyApi(xmodel.BaseApi[M]):
...     # These type-hints will inform the system of what type to use for each
...     # part. You don't have to create them now, they will be created on
...     # demand as needed.
...     #
...     # Defining/Overriding one in a sub-class will make the system use that
...     # type. You only need to define/override the specific ones you want to
...     # change/use. Any unspecified ones will each inherit from the
...     # super-class as you would expect.
...     auth: MyAuth
...     client: MyClient
...     settings: MySettings
...     structure: MyStructure[Field]
>>>
>>> class MyModel(xmodel.BaseModel):
...     # Same as in MyApi, this will inherit from superclass if not specified.
...     api: MyApi


The settings is more about making it easy to get the relevant config most-used by that
particular Api subclass.  The client is what the Api will allocate to do requests.

To subclass any of these, you can subclass the conreate versions
(classes the `xmodel` module that are not in `xmodel.orm_types` module).
But if you don't do that you must at least inherit from the abstract versions in the
`xmodel.orm_types` module, such as `xmodel.base.auth.BaseAuth`
(and other classes named like `class *Type`).

.. warning:: I would HIGHLY recommend you inherit from the concrete versions, even if
    you don't fully need all the features the concrete class needs.  You can just ignore
    the parts you don't need.

    [Type Converters Overview](./#type-converters).

    The class attribute defaults to `None`, but an instance/object will always have
    some sort of dict in place (happens during init call).

    Notice the `todo` note in the [overview](./#type-converters). I want it to work that way in the
    future (so via `BaseApi.set_default_converter` and `BaseApi.get_default_converter`).
    It's something coming in the future. For now you'll need to override
    `default_converters` and/or change it directly.

    You can provide your own values for this directly in a sub-class,
    when an BaseApi or subclass is created, we will merge converters in this order,
    with things later in the order taking precedence and override it:

    1. `xmodel.converters.DEFAULT_CONVERTERS`
    2. `BaseApi.default_converters` from `xmodel.base.model.BaseModel.api` from parent model.
        The parent model is the one the model is directly inheriting from.
    3. Finally, `BaseApi.default_converters` from the BaseApi subclass's class attribute
       (only looks on type/class directly for `default_converters`).

    It takes this final mapping and sets it on `self.default_converters`,
    and will be inherited as explained on on line number `2` above in the future.

    Default converters we have defined at the moment:

    - `xmodel.converters.convert_json_date`
    - `xmodel.converters.convert_json_datetime`
    - And a set of basic converters via `xmodel.converters.ConvertBasicType`, supports:
        - float
        - bool
        - str
        - int

    See `xmodel.converters.DEFAULT_CONVERTERS` to see the default converters map/dict.

    Maps type-hint to a default converter.  This converter will be used for `TypeValue.convert`
    when the model BaseStructure is create if none is provided for it at field definition time
    for a particular type-hint. If a type-hint is not in this converter, no convert is
    called for it.

    You don't need to provide one of these for a `xmodel.base.model.BaseModel` type-hint,
    as the system knows to call json/update_from_json on those types of objects.

    The default value provides a way to convert to/from a dt.date/dt.datetime and a string.

        .. warning:: You can probably skip the rest (below)
            Most of the time you don't create `BaseApi` objects your self, and so for most people
            you can skip the following unless you want to know more about internal details.

        # Init Method Specifics

        Normally you would not create an `BaseApi` object directly your self.
        `xmodel.base.model.BaseModel`'s know how to do this automatically.
        It happens in `xmodel.base.model.BaseModel.__init_subclass__`.

        Details about how the arguments you can pass are below.

        ## BaseModel Class Construction:

        If you provide an `api` arg without a `model` arg; we will copy the `BaseApi.structure`
        into new object, resetting the error status, and internal `BaseApi._state` to None.
        This `api` object is supposed to be the parent BaseModel's class api object.

        If both `api` arg + `model` arg are `None`, the BaseModel is the root/generic BaseModel
        (ie: it has no parent BaseModel).

        This is what is done by BaseModel classes while the class is lazily loading and
        creating/configuring the BaseModel class and it's associated `BaseApi` object
        (accessible via `xmodel.base.model.BaseModel.api`)

        ## BaseModel Instance Creation:

        If you also pass in a `model` arg; this get you a special copy of the api you passed in
        for use just with that BaseModel instance. The model `BaseApi._state` will be allocated
        internally in the init'd BaseApi object. This is how a `xmodel.base.model.BaseModel`
        instance get's it's own associated `BaseApi` object
        (that's a different instance vs the one set on BaseModel class when the BaseModel class
        was originally constructed).

        All params are optional.

        Args:
            api: The "parent" BaseApi obj to copy the basic structure from as a starting point,
                etc.
                The superclasses BaseApi class is passed via this arg.
                This is only used when allocating a new `BaseApi` object for a new
                `xmodel.base.model.BaseModel` class (not an instance, a model class/type).
                This BaseApi object is used for the class-level BaseModel api object;
                ie: via "ModelClass.api"

        """ REQUIRES associated model object (see `BaseApi.model` for details on this).

        Return associated model object as a JsonDict (str keys, any value), ready to be encoded
        via JSON encoder and sent to the API.

        Args:
            only_include_changes: If True, will only include what changed in the JsonDict result.
                Defaults to False.
                This is normally set to True if system is sending this object via PATCH, which is
                the  normal way the system sends objects to API.

                If only_include_changes is False (default), we always include everything that
                is not 'None'.
                When a `xmodel.base.client.BaseClient` subclass
                (such as `xmodel.rest.RestClient`)
                calls this method, it will pass in a value based on it's own
                `xmodel.rest.RestClient.enable_send_changes_only` is set to
                (defaults to False there too).
                You can override the RestClient.enable_send_changes_only at the BaseModel class
                level by making a RestClient subclass and setting `enable_send_changes_only` to
                default to `True`.

                There is a situations where we have to include all attributes, regardless:
                    1. If the 'id' field is set to a 'None' value. This indicates we need to create
                       a new object, and we are not partially updating an existing one, even if we
                       got updated via json at some point in the past.

                As always, properties set to None will *NOT* be included in returned JsonDict,
                regardless of what options have been set.

            log_output (bool): If False (default): won't log anything.
                If True: Logs what method returns at debug level.

           include_removals (bool): If False (default): won't include in response any fields
                that have been removed
                (vs when compared to the original JSON that updated this object).
                The value will be the special sentinel object `Remove`
                (see top of this module/file for `Remove` object, and it's `RemoveType` class).

        Returns:
            JsonDict: Will the needed attributes that should be sent to API.
                If returned value is None, that means only_include_changes is True
                and there were no changes.

                The returned dict is a copy and so can be mutated be the caller.
