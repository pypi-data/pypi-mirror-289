    For instance, `statute.py` will use this function to create an html

    a large dynamically generated tree into a single field for sqlite
    to store. Without this, it would be necessary to reconstruct the tree
    and this takes a substantial amount of time.

    This same mechanism can dynamically create subtrees, given a specific
