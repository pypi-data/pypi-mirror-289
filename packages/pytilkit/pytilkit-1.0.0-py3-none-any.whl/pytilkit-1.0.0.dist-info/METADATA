# pytilkit - V1.0.0

![LOGO](https://i.ibb.co/QrsjSgP/logo.png)

pytilkit is a python library which contains many code snippets that one uses quite a lot. We pride ourselves on backwards compatibility.
We will not be deprecating any feature or removing it. All old snippet functions will work even if you update the package.

Hi, I'm ItzSCodez1467 A.K.A. Srijal Dutta. I consider myself an intermediate programmer. In usually work with python for backend and for the frontend which I rarely add to my projects I have made quite a few projects, but I don't want to really share them as they are not really that important. I'll keep adding some projects over time.

## Usage

> Clear Screen

- Directly call function

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

pbu.clearScreen()
```

- Use alias function

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

pbu.clsScreen()
```

> Maths

- Add numbers

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

z = pbu.add(1, 1)
print(z)
```

- Subtracting numbers

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

z = pbu.sub(1, 1)
print(z)
```

- Multiplying numbers

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

z = pbu.mul(1, 1)
print(z)
```

- Divide numbers

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

z = pbu.div(1, 1)
print(z)
```

- Area of square

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

z = pbu.area.square(5)
print(z)
```

- Area of Rectangle

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

z = pbu.area.rect(5, 5)
print(z)
```

- Area of Circle

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

z = pbu.area.circ(5)
print(z)
```

-  Area of Triangle 

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

z = pbu.area.tri(5, 5, 5)
print(z)
```

>  Jsoned

-  Read Data

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

print(pbu.read_json("path/to/file.json"))
```

-  Write Data

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

data = {"Data": True}
pbu.write_json("path/to/file.json", data) # Indentation option also available. Indent is 4 by default.
```

> File Size

-  In MB

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

print(pbu.fileSizeMB("path/to/file.txt"))
```

-  In GB

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

print(pbu.fileSizeGB("path/to/file.txt"))
```

>  Encryption and Decryption(RSA)

-  Generate Key Pairs

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

private_pem, public_pem = pbu.generate_key_pair()
print("Private Key:\n", private_pem)
print("Public Key:\n", public_pem)
```

-  Encryption with Public Key

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

message = "Hello, World!"
public_pem = """-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
... (public key content here) ...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"""

encrypted_message = pbu.encrypt_with_public_key(public_pem, message)
print("Encrypted message:", encrypted_message)
```

-  Decryption with Private Key

```python
import pytilkit as pbu

# Generate key pairs
private_pem, public_pem = pbu.generate_key_pair()
print("Private Key:\n", private_pem)
print("Public Key:\n", public_pem)

# Encrypt a message using the public key
message = "Hello, World!"
encrypted_message = pbu.encrypt_with_public_key(public_pem, message)
print("Encrypted message:", encrypted_message)

# Decrypt the encrypted message using the private key
# Note: In an actual implementation, the private key should be securely input.
decrypted_message = pbu.decrypt_with_private_key(encrypted_message)
print("Decrypted message:", decrypted_message)
```
