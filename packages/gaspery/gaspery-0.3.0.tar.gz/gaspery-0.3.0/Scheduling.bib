	abstract = {The mutual inclination between planets orbiting the same star provides key information to understand the formation and evolution of multiplanet systems. In this work, we investigate the potential of Gaia astrometry in detecting and characterizing cold Jupiters in orbits exterior to the currently known Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) planet candidates. According to our simulations, out of the ∼3350 systems expected to have cold Jupiter companions, Gaia, by its nominal 5 yr mission, should be able to detect ∼200 cold Jupiters and measure the orbital inclinations with a precision of in ∼120 of them. These numbers are estimated under the assumption that the orbital orientations of the CJs follow an isotropic distribution, but these only vary slightly for less broad distributions. We also discuss the prospects from radial velocity follow-ups to better constrain the derived properties and provide a package to do quick forecasts using our Fisher matrix analysis. Overall, our simulations show that Gaia astrometry of cold Jupiters orbiting stars with TESS planets can distinguish dynamically cold (mean mutual inclination ≲5°) from dynamically hot systems (mean mutual inclination ≳20°), placing a new set of constraints on their formation and evolution.},

	abstract = {Since the discovery of the transiting super-Earth CoRoT-7b, several investigations have yielded different results for the number and masses of planets present in the system, mainly owing to the star’s high level of activity. We re-observed CoRoT-7 in 2012 January with both HARPS and CoRoT, so that we now have the beneﬁt of simultaneous radial-velocity and photometric data. This allows us to use the off-transit variations in the star’s light curve to estimate the radialvelocity variations induced by the suppression of convective blueshift and the ﬂux blocked by starspots. To account for activity-related effects in the radial velocities which do not have a photometric signature, we also include an additional activity term in the radial-velocity model, which we treat as a Gaussian process with the same covariance properties (and hence the same frequency structure) as the light curve. Our model was incorporated into a Monte Carlo Markov Chain in order to make a precise determination of the orbits of CoRoT-7b and CoRoT-7c. We measure the masses of planets b and c to be 4.73 ± 0.95 and 13.56 ± 1.08 M⊕, respectively. The density of CoRoT-7b is (6.61 ± 1.72)(Rp/1.58 R⊕)−3 g cm−3, which is compatible with a rocky composition. We search for evidence of an additional planet d, identiﬁed by previous authors with a period close to 9 d. We are not able to conﬁrm the existence of a planet with this orbital period, which is close to the second harmonic of the stellar rotation at ∼7.9 d. Using Bayesian model selection, we ﬁnd that a model with two planets plus activity-induced variations is most favoured.},

	abstract = {The past two decades have seen a major expansion in the availability, size, and precision of time-domain data sets in astronomy. Owing to their unique combination of flexibility, mathematical simplicity, and comparative robustness, Gaussian processes (GPs) have emerged recently as the solution of choice to model stochastic signals in such data sets. In this review, we provide a brief introduction to the emergence of GPs in astronomy, present the underlying mathematical theory, and give practical advice considering the key modeling choices involved in GP regression. We then review applications of GPs to time-domain data sets in the astrophysical literature so far, from exoplanets to active galactic nuclei, showcasing the power and flexibility of the method. We provide worked examples using simulated data, with links to the source code; discuss the problem of computational cost and scalability; and give a snapshot of the current ecosystem of open-source GP software packages. In summary: ▪ GP regression is a conceptually simple but statistically principled and powerful tool for the analysis of astronomical time series. ▪ It is already widely used in some subfields, such as exoplanets, and gaining traction in many others, such as optical transients. ▪ Driven by further algorithmic and conceptual advances, we expect that GPs will continue to be an important tool for robust and interpretable time-domain astronomy for many years to come.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Gaussian Process (GP) regression has become widely used to analyse stellar and exoplanet time-series data sets. For spotted stars, the most popular GP covariance function is the quasi-periodic (QP) kernel, whose hyperparameters of the GP have a plausible interpretation in terms of physical properties of the star and spots. In this paper, we test the reliability of this interpretation by modelling data simulated using a spot model using a QP GP, and the recently proposed quasi-periodic plus cosine (QPC) GP, comparing the posterior distributions of the GP hyperparameters to the input parameters of the spot model. We find excellent agreement between the input stellar rotation period and the QP and QPC GP period, and very good agreement between the spot decay time-scale and the length scale of the squared exponential term. We also compare the hyperparameters derived from light and radial velocity (RV) curves for a given star, finding that the period and evolution time-scales are in good agreement. However, the harmonic complexity of the GP, while displaying no clear correlation with the spot properties in our simulations, is systematically higher for the RV than for the light-curve data. Finally, for the QP kernel, we investigate the impact of noise and time-sampling on the hyperparameters in the case of RVs. Our results indicate that good coverage of rotation period and spot evolution time-scales is more important than the total number of points, and noise characteristics govern the harmonic complexity.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

	abstract = {AU Mic is a young (22 Myr) nearby exoplanetary system that exhibits excess TTVs that cannot be accounted for by the two known transiting planets nor stellar activity. In this work, we present the validation of the candidate planet AU Mic d. We add 18 new transits and nine midpoint times in an updated TTV analysis to prior work. We perform the joint modeling of transit light curves using EXOFASTv2 and extract the transit midpoint times. Next, we construct an O-C diagram and use Exo-Striker to model the TTVs. We generate TTV log-likelihood periodograms to explore possible solutions for the period of planet d and then follow those up with detailed TTV and RV MCMC modeling and stability tests. We find several candidate periods for AU Mic d, all of which are near resonances with AU Mic b and c of varying order. Based on our model comparisons, the most-favored orbital period of AU Mic d is 12.73812+/-0.00128 days (T\_\{C,d\}=2458333.32110+/-0.35836 BJD), which puts the three planets near a 4:6:9 mean-motion orbital resonance. The mass for d is M\_d=1.013+/-0.146 M\_E, making this planet Earth-like in mass. The presence of orbital resonances in a very young system implies that compact planetary systems can develop resonant chains very early on, which can quickly establish the stability of the systems. Additional TTV observation of the AU Mic system are needed to further constrain the planetary masses, search for possible transits of AU Mic d, and detect possible additional planets beyond AU Mic c.},

	abstract = {To date, the radial velocity (RV) method has been one of the most productive techniques for detecting and confirming extrasolar planetary candidates. Unfortunately, stellar activity can induce RV variations which can drown out or even mimic planetary signals - and it is notoriously difficult to model and thus mitigate the effects of these activity-induced nuisance signals. This is expected to be a major obstacle to using next-generation spectrographs to detect lower mass planets, planets with longer periods, and planets around more active stars. Enter Gaussian processes (GPs) which, we note, have a number of attractive features that make them very well suited to disentangling stellar activity signals from planetary signals. We present here a GP framework we developed to model RV time series jointly with ancillary activity indicators (e.g. bisector velocity spans, line widths, chromospheric activity indices), allowing the activity component of RV time series to be constrained and disentangled from e.g. planetary components. We discuss the mathematical details of our GP framework, and present results illustrating its encouraging performance on both synthetic and real RV data sets, including the publicly available Alpha Centauri B data set.},

The goal of this paper is to compare the efficiency of these different methods to recover extremely low-mass planets despite stellar RV signals.

These recovery rates drop dramatically for {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater} smaller than this threshold. In addition, for the best teams, no false positives with {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textgreater} 7.5 were detected, while a non-negligible fraction of them appear for smaller {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. A limit of {\textless}i{\textgreater}K{\textless}i/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 7.5 seems therefore a safe threshold to attest the veracity of planetary signals for RV measurements with similar properties to those of the different RV fitting challenge systems.},

	abstract = {Developments in the stability of modern spectrographs have led to extremely precise instrumental radial velocity (RV) measurements. For most stars, the detection limit of planetary companions with these instruments is expected to be dominated by astrophysical noise sources such as starspots. Correlated signals caused by rotationally modulated starspots can obscure or mimic the Doppler shifts induced by even the closest, most massive planets. This is especially true for young, magnetically active stars where stellar activity can cause fluctuation amplitudes of ≳0.1 mag in brightness and ≳100 m s−1 in RV semiamplitudes. Techniques that can mitigate these effects and increase our sensitivity to young planets are critical to improving our understanding of the evolution of planetary systems. Gaussian processes (GPs) have been successfully employed to model and constrain activity signals in individual cases. However, a principled approach of this technique, specifically for the joint modeling of photometry and RVs, has not yet been developed. In this work, we present a GP framework to simultaneously model stellar activity signals in photometry and RVs that can be used to investigate the relationship between both time series. Our method, inspired by the FF framework of Aigrain et al., models spot-driven activity signals as the linear combinations of two independent latent GPs and their time derivatives. We also simulate time series affected by starspots by extending the starry software to incorporate time evolution of stellar features. Using these synthetic data sets, we show that our method can predict spot-driven RV variations with greater accuracy than other GP approaches.},

	abstract = {Measured spectral shifts due to intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., pulsations, granulation) and activity (e.g., spots, plages) are the largest source of error for extreme-precision radial-velocity (EPRV) exoplanet detection. Several methods are designed to disentangle stellar signals from true center-of-mass shifts due to planets. The Extreme-precision Spectrograph (EXPRES) Stellar Signals Project (ESSP) presents a self-consistent comparison of 22 different methods tested on the same extreme-precision spectroscopic data from EXPRES. Methods derived new activity indicators, constructed models for mapping an indicator to the needed radial-velocity (RV) correction, or separated out shape- and shift-driven RV components. Since no ground truth is known when using real data, relative method performance is assessed using the total and nightly scatter of returned RVs and agreement between the results of different methods. Nearly all submitted methods return a lower RV rms than classic linear decorrelation, but no method is yet consistently reducing the RV rms to sub-meter-per-second levels. There is a concerning lack of agreement between the RVs returned by different methods. These results suggest that continued progress in this field necessitates increased interpretability of methods, high-cadence data to capture stellar signals at all timescales, and continued tests like the ESSP using consistent data sets with more advanced metrics for method performance. Future comparisons should make use of various well-characterized data sets—such as solar data or data with known injected planetary and/or stellar signals—to better understand method performance and whether planetary signals are preserved.},

	abstract = {We have recently carried out spectral synthesis modeling to determine Teff, logg, vsini, and [Fe/H] for 1040 FGK-type stars on the Keck, Lick, and Anglo-Australian Telescope planet search programs. This is the first time that a single, uniform spectroscopic analysis has been made for every star on a large Doppler planet search survey. We identify a subset of 850 stars that have Doppler observations sufficient to detect uniformly all planets with radial velocity semiamplitudes K{\textbackslash}textgreater30 m s-1 and orbital periods shorter than 4 yr. From this subset of stars, we determine that fewer than 3\% of stars with -0.5{\textbackslash}textless[Fe/H]{\textbackslash}textless0.0 have Doppler-detected planets. Above solar metallicity, there is a smooth and rapid rise in the fraction of stars with planets. At [Fe/H]{\textbackslash}textgreater+0.3 dex, 25\% of observed stars have detected gas giant planets. A power-law fit to these data relates the formation probability for gas giant planets to the square of the number of metal atoms. High stellar metallicity also appears to be correlated with the presence of multiple-planet systems and with the total detected planet mass. This data set was examined to better understand the origin of high metallicity in stars with planets. None of the expected fossil signatures of accretion are observed in stars with planets relative to the general sample: (1) metallicity does not appear to increase as the mass of the convective envelopes decreases, (2) subgiants with planets do not show dilution of metallicity, (3) no abundance variations for Na, Si, Ti, or Ni are found as a function of condensation temperature, and (4) no correlations between metallicity and orbital period or eccentricity could be identified. We conclude that stars with extrasolar planets do not have an accretion signature that distinguishes them from other stars; more likely, they are simply born in higher metallicity molecular clouds.

	abstract = {The planet–metallicity correlation serves as a potential link between exoplanet systems as we observe them today and the effects of bulk composition on the planet formation process. Many observers have noted a tendency for Jovian planets to form around stars with higher metallicities; however, there is no consensus on a trend for smaller planets. Here, we investigate the planet–metallicity correlation for rocky planets in single- and multi-planet systems around Kepler M-dwarf and late-K-dwarf stars. Due to molecular blanketing and the dim nature of these low-mass stars, it is difficult to make direct elemental abundance measurements via spectroscopy. We instead use a combination of accurate and uniformly measured parallaxes and photometry to obtain relative metallicities and validate this method with a subsample of spectroscopically determined metallicities. We use the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K-S) test, Mann–Whitney U-test, and Anderson–Darling (AD) test to compare the compact multiple planetary systems with single-transiting planet systems and systems with no detected transiting planets. We find that the compact multiple planetary systems are derived from a statistically more metal-poor population, with a p-value of 0.015 in the K-S test, a p-value of 0.005 in the Mann–Whitney U-test, and a value of 2.574 in the AD test statistic, which exceeds the derived threshold for significance by a factor of 25. We conclude that metallicity plays a significant role in determining the architecture of rocky planet systems. Compact multiples either form more readily, or are more likely to survive on gigayear timescales, around metal-poor stars.},

	abstract = {We present simulations of multi-year radial velocity (RV) follow-up campaigns of the TESS exoplanet yield on the Automated Planet Finder telescope, using four different schemes to sample the transiting planets’ RV phase curves. For planets below roughly 10 M ⊕, we see a systematic bias of measured masses that are higher than the true planet mass, regardless of the observing scheme used. This produces a statistically significant difference in the mass-radius relation we recover, where planet masses are predicted to be too high and too similar across the entire super-Earth to Neptune radius range. This bias is due in part to only reporting masses that are measured with high statistical significance. Incorporating all mass measurements, even those that are essentially only upper limits, significantly mitigates this bias. We also find statistically significant differences between the mean number of planets measured at the 1-, 3-, and 5σ K level by the different prioritization schemes. Our results show that prioritization schemes which more evenly sample the RV phase curves produce a larger number of significant mass detections. The scheme that aims to most uniformly sample the phase curve performs best, followed closely by the scheme that randomly samples, and then an in-quadrature sampling approach. The fourth scheme, out of quadrature, performs noticeably worse. These results have important implications for determining accurate planet compositions and for designing effective RV follow-up campaigns in the era of large planet detection surveys such as K2, TESS, and PLATO.},

In the latter option, we took into account the reduction in the number of recorded photons due to a transmittance lower than unity and considered its effect on the noise of the recorded spectra.

For M6-M9 stars, the bands show a difference in precision that is within a factor of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde2 and does not clearly depend on the band; this difference is reduced to a factor smaller than {\textbackslash}textasciitilde1.5 if we consider a non-rotating star seen at high resolution. We also show that an M6-M9 spectrum will deliver a precision about two times better as an M0-M3 spectra with the same signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we note that the details of modeling the Earth atmosphere and interpreting the results have a significant impact on which wavelength regions are discarded when setting a limit threshold at 2−3\%. The resolution element sampling on the observed spectra plays an important role in the atmospheric transmission characterization. As a result of the multiparameter nature of the problem, it is very difficult to precisely quantify the impact of absorption by the telluric lines on the RV precision, but it is an important limiting factor to the achievable RV precision.},

	abstract = {Kepler has revolutionized the study of transiting planets with its unprecedented photometric precision on more than 150,000 target stars. Most of the transiting planet candidates detected by Kepler have been observed as long-cadence targets with 30 minute integration times, and the upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite will record full frame images with a similar integration time. Integrations of 30 minutes affect the transit shape, particularly for small planets and in cases of low signal to noise. Using the Fisher information matrix technique, we derive analytic approximations for the variances and covariances on the transit parameters obtained from ﬁtting light curve photometry collected with a ﬁnite integration time. We ﬁnd that binning the light curve can signiﬁcantly increase the uncertainties and covariances on the inferred parameters when comparing scenarios with constant total signal to noise (constant total integration time in the absence of read noise). Uncertainties on the transit ingress/egress time increase by a factor of 34 for Earth-size planets and 3.4 for Jupiter-size planets around Sun-like stars for integration times of 30 minutes compared to instantaneously sampled light curves. Similarly, uncertainties on the mid-transit time for Earth and Jupiter-size planets increase by factors of 3.9 and 1.4. Uncertainties on the transit depth are largely unaffected by ﬁnite integration times. While correlations among the transit depth, ingress duration, and transit duration all increase in magnitude with longer integration times, the mid-transit time remains uncorrelated with the other parameters. We provide code in Python and Mathematica for predicting the variances and covariances at www.its.caltech.edu/∼eprice.},

We also assess the advantages of some relatively uncorrelated parameter sets for fitting actual data. When limb darkening is significant, our parameter sets are still useful, although our analytic formulae underpredict the covariances and uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Two of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite’s major science goals are to measure masses for 50 planets smaller than 4 Earth radii and to discover high-quality targets for atmospheric characterization efforts. It is important that these two goals are linked by quantifying what precision of mass constraint is required to yield robust atmospheric properties of planets. Here, we address this by conducting retrievals on simulated James Webb Space Telescope transmission spectra under various assumptions for the degree of uncertainty in the planets mass for a representative population of seven planets ranging from terrestrials to warm Neptunes to hot Jupiters. Only for the cloud-free, low-metallicity gas giants are we able to infer exoplanet mass from transmission spectroscopy alone, to ∼10\% accuracy. For low-metallicity cases ({\textbackslash}textless4× solar) we are able to accurately constrain atmospheric properties without prior knowledge of the planet’s mass. For all other cases (including terrestrial-like planets), atmospheric properties can only be inferred with a mass precision of better than ±50\%. At this level, though, the widths of the posterior distributions of the atmospheric properties are dominated by the uncertainties in mass. With a precision of ±20\%, the widths of the posterior distributions are dominated by the spectroscopic data quality. Therefore, as a rule of thumb, we recommend a ±50\% mass precision for initial atmospheric characterization and a ±20\% mass precision for more detailed atmospheric analyses.},

TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with IC≈4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

Our radial velocity (RV) time-series exhibits activity-induced fluctuations of 45 m s−1 rms, ∼3 times smaller than those measured in the optical domain, that we filter using Gaussian Process Regression. We report a 3.9σ detection of the recently discovered 8.46 -d transiting planet AU Mic b, with an estimated mass of 17.1{\textbackslash}ˆ\{+4.7\}\_\{-4.5\}{\textbackslash} M⊕ and a bulk density of 1.3 ± 0.4 g cm−3, inducing an RV signature of semi-amplitude K = 8.5{\textbackslash}ˆ\{+2.3\}\_\{-2.2\}{\textbackslash} m s−1 in the spectrum of its host star. A consistent detection is independently obtained when we simultaneously image stellar surface inhomogeneities and estimate the planet parameters with Zeeman–Doppler imaging (ZDI). Using ZDI, we invert the time-series of unpolarized and circularly polarized spectra into surface brightness and large-scale magnetic maps. We find a mainly poloidal and axisymmetric field of 475 G, featuring, in particular, a dipole of 450 G tilted at 19° to the rotation axis. Moreover, we detect a strong differential rotation of dΩ = 0.167 ± 0.009 rad d−1 shearing the large-scale field, about twice stronger than that shearing the brightness distribution, suggesting that both observables probe different layers of the convective zone. Even though we caution that more RV measurements are needed to accurately pin down the planet mass, AU Mic b already appears as a prime target for constraining planet formation models, studying the interactions with the surrounding debris disc, and characterizing its atmosphere with upcoming space- and ground-based missions.},

Many TESS discoveries will be amenable to mass characterization via ground-based radial velocity measurements with any of a growing suite of existing and anticipated velocimeters in the optical and near-infrared. In this study we present an analytical formalism to compute the number of radial velocity measurements—and hence the total observing time—required to characterize RV planet masses with the inclusion of either a white or correlated noise activity model. We use our model to calculate the total observing time required to measure all TESS planet masses from the expected TESS planet yield while relying on our current understanding of the targeted stars, stellar activity, and populations of unseen planets which inform the expected radial velocity precision. We also present specialized calculations applicable to a variety of interesting TESS planet subsets including the characterization of 50 planets smaller than 4 Earth radii which is expected to take as little as 60 nights of observation. Although, the efficient RV characterization of such planets requires a-priori knowledge of the `best' targets which we argue can be identified prior to the conclusion of the TESS planet search based on our calculations. Our results highlight the comparable performance of optical and near-IR spectrographs for most planet populations except for Earths and temperate TESS planets which are more efficiently characterized in the near-IR. Lastly, we present an online tool to the community to compute the total observing times required to detect any transiting planet using a user-defined spectrograph.},

In particular, suppression of convective blueshift and brightness inhomogeneities due to photospheric faculae/plage and starspots are the dominant contribution to the variability of such stellar RVs. Gaussian process (GP) regression is a powerful tool for statistically modeling these quasi-periodic variations. We investigate the limits of this technique using 800 days of RVs from the solar telescope on the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) spectrograph. These data provide a well-sampled time series of stellar RV variations. Into this data set, we inject Keplerian signals with periods between 100 and 500 days and amplitudes between 0.6 and 2.4 m s−1. We use GP regression to fit the resulting RVs and determine the statistical significance of recovered periods and amplitudes. We then generate synthetic RVs with the same covariance properties as the solar data to determine a lower bound on the observational baseline necessary to detect low-mass planets in Venus-like orbits around a Sun-like star. Our simulations show that discovering planets with a larger mass (∼0.5 m s−1) using current-generation spectrographs and GP regression will require more than 12 yr of densely sampled RV observations. Furthermore, even with a perfect model of stellar variability, discovering a true exo-Venus (∼0.1 m s−1) with current instruments would take over 15 yr. Therefore, next-generation spectrographs and better models of stellar variability are required for detection of such planets.},

It is designed with the needs of extreme-precision radial-velocity (EPRV) instruments in mind, which require calibration or stabilization to better than 10−4 pixels. Instruments vary along only a few dominant degrees of freedom, especially EPRV instruments that feature highly stabilized optical systems and detectors. Excalibur takes advantage of this property by using all calibration data to construct a low-dimensional representation of all accessible calibration states for an instrument. Excalibur also takes advantage of laser-frequency combs or etalons, which generate a dense set of stable calibration points. This density permits the use of a nonparametric wavelength solution that can adapt to any instrument or detector oddities better than parametric models, such as a polynomial. We demonstrate the success of this method with data from the Extreme Precision Spectrograph (EXPRES), which uses a laser-frequency comb. When wavelengths are assigned to laser comb lines using excalibur, the rms of the residuals is about one-fifth that of wavelengths assigned using polynomial fits to individual exposures. Radial-velocity measurements of HD 34411 show a reduction in rms scatter over a 10 month time baseline from 1.17 to 1.05 m s−1.},

Automated scheduling algorithms present an opportunity to save human effort and increase scientific productivity. A common scheduling challenge involves determining the optimal ordering of a set of targets over a night subject to timing constraints and time-dependent slew overheads. We present a solution to the “traveling telescope problem” that uses mixed-integer linear programming. This algorithm is fast enough to enable dynamic schedule generation in many astronomical contexts. It can determine the optimal solution for 100 observations within 10 minutes on a modern workstation, reducing slew overheads by a factor of 5 compared to random ordering. We also provide a heuristic method that can return a near-optimal solution at significantly reduced computational cost. As a case study, we explore our algorithm’s suitability to automatic schedule generation for Doppler planet searches.},

Transmission spectroscopy relies on a precise understanding of the spectrum of the star being occulted. However, stars are not homogeneous, constant light sources but have temporally evolving photospheres and chromospheres with inhomogeneities like spots, faculae, plages, granules, and flares. This SAG brought together an interdisciplinary team of more than 100 scientists, with observers and theorists from the heliophysics, stellar astrophysics, planetary science, and exoplanetary atmosphere research communities, to study the current research needs that can be addressed in this context to make the most of transit studies from current NASA facilities like Hubble Space Telescope and JWST. The analysis produced 14 findings, which fall into three science themes encompassing (i) how the Sun is used as our best laboratory to calibrate our understanding of stellar heterogeneities (‘The Sun as the Stellar Benchmark’), (ii) how stars other than the Sun extend our knowledge of heterogeneities (‘Surface Heterogeneities of Other Stars’), and (iii) how to incorporate information gathered for the Sun and other stars into transit studies (‘Mapping Stellar Knowledge to Transit Studies’). In this invited review, we largely reproduce the final report of SAG21 as a contribution to the peer-reviewed literature.},

Modern spectrographs promise measurement precision of 0.2–0.5 m s−1 for an ideal target star. However, the intrinsic variability of stellar spectra can mimic and obscure true planet signals at these levels. Rajpaul et al. and Jones et al. proposed applying a physically motivated, multivariate Gaussian process (GP) to jointly model the apparent Doppler shift and multiple indicators of stellar activity as a function of time, so as to separate the planetary signal from various forms of stellar variability. These methods are promising, but performing the necessary calculations can be computationally intensive and algebraically tedious. In this work, we present a flexible and computationally efficient software package, GPLinearODEMaker.jl, for modeling multivariate time series using a linear combination of univariate GPs and their derivatives. The package allows users to easily and efficiently apply various multivariate GP models and different covariance kernel functions. We demonstrate GPLinearODEMaker.jl by applying the Jones et al. model to fit measurements of the apparent Doppler shift and activity indicators derived from simulated active solar spectra time series affected by many evolving starspots. We show how GPLinearODEMaker.jl makes it easy to explore the effect of different choices for the GP kernel. We find that local kernels could significantly increase the sensitivity and precision of Doppler planet searches relative to the widely used quasiperiodic kernel.},

But survey success will depend critically on the choice of observing strategy, which will determine the survey's ability to mitigate known sources of noise and extract low-amplitude exoplanet signals. Here, we present an analysis of the Fisher information content of simulated EPRV surveys, accounting for the most recent advances in our understanding of stellar variability on both short and long timescales (i.e., oscillations and granulation within individual nights, and activity-induced variations across multiple nights). In this analysis, we capture the correlated nature of stellar variability by parameterizing these signals with Gaussian Process kernels. We describe the underlying simulation framework as well as the physical interpretation of the Fisher information content, and we evaluate the efficacy of EPRV survey strategies that have been presented in the literature. We explore and compare strategies for scheduling observations over various timescales and we make recommendations to optimize survey performance for the detection of Earth-like exoplanets.},

	abstract = {Precise mass measurements of exoplanets discovered by the direct imaging or transit technique are required to determine planet bulk properties and potential habitability. Furthermore, it is generally acknowledged that, for the foreseeable future, the Extreme Precision Radial Velocity (EPRV) measurement technique is the only method potentially capable of detecting and measuring the masses and orbits of habitable-zone Earths orbiting nearby F, G, and K spectral-type stars from the ground. In particular, EPRV measurements with a precision of better than approximately 10 cm/s (with a few cm/s stability over many years) are required. Unfortunately, for nearly a decade, PRV instruments and surveys have been unable to routinely reach RV accuracies of less than roughly 1 m/s. Making EPRV science and technology development a critical component of both NASA and NSF program plans is crucial for reaching the goal of detecting potentially habitable Earthlike planets and supporting potential future exoplanet direct imaging missions such as the Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) or the Large Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR). In recognition of these facts, the 2018 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Exoplanet Science Strategy (ESS) report recommended the development of EPRV measurements as a critical step toward the detection and characterization of habitable, Earth-analog planets. In response to the NAS-ESS recommendation, NASA and NSF commissioned the EPRV Working Group to recommend a ground-based program architecture and implementation plan to achieve the goal intended by the NAS. This report documents the activities, findings, and recommendations of the EPRV Working Group.},

A major obstacle to this goal is astrophysical RV noise caused by active areas moving across the stellar limb as a star rotates. In this paper, we quantify how stellar activity impacts exoplanet detection with radial velocities as a function of orbital and stellar rotational periods. We perform data-driven simulations of how stellar rotation affects planet detectability and compile and present relations for the typical time-scale and amplitude of stellar RV noise as a function of stellar mass. We show that the characteristic time-scales of quasi-periodic RV jitter from stellar rotational modulations coincides with the orbital period of habitable-zone exoplanets around early M-dwarfs. These coincident periods underscore the importance of monitoring the targets of RV habitable-zone planet surveys through simultaneous photometric measurements for determining rotation periods and activity signals, and mitigating activity signals using spectroscopic indicators and/or RV measurements at different wavelengths.},

They are introducing a novel physical regime that has not been explored before, as such planets do not exist in our solar system. Their compositions can be completely terrestrial, or they may harbor an extensive ocean (water and ices) above a rocky core. We model the structure and properties of the ﬁrst super-Earth (mass \$7.5 MÈ), discovered in 2005, illustrating the possible compositions and providing radius evaluations in view of future detection of similar planets by transits. We ﬁnd that there exists a threshold in radius above which a super-Earth most certainly has an extensive water content. In the case of GJ 876d, this threshold is at about 12,000 km. Our results show that unique characterization of the bulk composition of super-Earths will be possible with future transit studies.},

	abstract = {We use new interior models of cold planets to investigate the mass-radius relationships of solid exoplanets, considering planets made primarily of iron, silicates, water, and carbon compounds. We find that the mass-radius relationships for cold terrestrial mass planets of all compositions we considered follow a generic functional form that is not a simple power law: log10Rs=k1+1/3log10(Ms)-k2Mk3s for up to Mp{\textasciitilde}20 M⊕, where Ms and Rs are scaled mass and radius values. This functional form arises because the common building blocks of solid planets all have equations of state that are well approximated by a modified polytrope of the form ρ=ρ0+cPn. We find that highly detailed planet interior models, including temperature structure and phase changes, are not necessary to derive solid exoplanet bulk composition from mass and radius measurements. For solid exoplanets with no substantial atmosphere we have also found the following: with 5\% fractional uncertainty in planet mass and radius it is possible to distinguish among planets composed predominantly of iron or silicates or water ice but not more detailed compositions; with {\textasciitilde}5\% uncertainty water ice planets with {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}25\% water by mass may be identified; the minimum plausible planet size for a given mass is that of a pure iron planet; and carbon planet mass-radius relationships overlap with those of silicate and water planets due to similar zero-pressure densities and equations of state. We propose a definition of ``super-Earths'' based on the clear distinction in radii between planets with significant gas envelopes and those without.},

	abstract = {To aid in the physical interpretation of planetary radii constrained through observations of transiting planets, or eventually direct detections, we compute model radii of pure hydrogen-helium, water, rock, and iron planets, along with various mixtures. Masses ranging from 0.01 Earth masses to 10 Jupiter masses at orbital distances of 0.02-10 AU are considered. For hydrogen-helium rich planets, our models are the first to couple planetary evolution to stellar irradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02-10 AU) through a nongray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. Stellar irradiation retards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simple function of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 AU contracts as slowly as a planet at 0.1 AU. We confirm the assertion of Guillot that very old giant planets under modest stellar irradiation (like that received by Jupiter and Saturn) develop isothermal atmospheric radiative zones once the planet's intrinsic flux drops to a small fraction of the incident flux. For hydrogen-helium planets, we consider cores up to 90\% of the total planet mass, comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune. If ``hot Neptunes'' have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of more massive planets, radii of {\textasciitilde}0.30-0.45 RJ are expected. Water planets are {\textasciitilde}40\%-50\% larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. Finally, we provide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and for ice-rock-iron planets we fit our results to analytic functions, which will allow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or mass estimates, given only planetary radii. These results will assist in the interpretation of observations for both the current transiting planet surveys as well as upcoming space missions, including COROT and Kepler.},

	abstract = {Population studies of Kepler's multiplanet systems have revealed a surprising degree of structure in their underlying architectures. Information from a detected transiting planet can be combined with a population model to make predictions about the presence and properties of additional planets in the system. Using a statistical model for the distribution of planetary systems, we compute the conditional occurrence of planets as a function of the period and radius of Kepler-detectable planets. About half (0.52 ± 0.03) of the time, the detected planet is not the planet with the largest semi-amplitude (K) in the system, so efforts to measure the mass of the transiting planet with radial velocity (RV) follow up will have to contend with additional planetary signals in the data. We simulate RV observations to show that assuming a single-planet model to measure the K of the transiting planet often requires significantly more observations than in the ideal case with no additional planets, due to systematic errors from unseen planet companions. Our results show that planets around 10 day periods with K close to the single-measurement RV precision (σ 1,obs) typically require ∼100 observations to measure their K to within 20\% error. For a next generation RV instrument achieving σ 1,obs = 10 cm s−1, about ∼200 (600) observations are needed to measure the K of a transiting Venus in a Kepler-like system to better than 20\% (10\%) error, which is ∼2.3 times as many as would be necessary for a Venus without any planetary companions.},
