# Note on RAGAS:
# RAGAS requires `langchain-openai`, which asks for python>=3.8.1
# this means when doing `poetry lock`, it will fail due to the >= 3.8 constraint
# poetry has no easy fix for this (see poetry issue #697)
# we have discussed internally that we'd rather do the following workaround for now:
#   1. temporally bump mindsdb_evaluator in version range to `>=3.8.1,<3.12`
#   2. generate `poetry.lock` file via `poetry lock`
#   3. undo the version range bump to the original: `>=3.8,<3.12`
#   4. push, everything works as normal (3.8.0 is not really used anywhere,
#      but we'd rather keep as is for now instead of updating all our libraries)
