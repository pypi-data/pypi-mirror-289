# osbee
Utilities for OSBee-3.0 device from OpenSprinkler

The OSBeeAPI class wraps an async client of the OSBee REST API to make it look like a few
independent valves.  Essentially split off from my HomeAssistant integration.


## Can I talk to my OSBee?

My personal OSBee is a v1.0.0; I've been chatting with someone whose v1.0.2 behaves a bit
differently.  examples/dump_status.py can be used to connect to an OSBee and see if we can read the
status of the valves and the OSBee in general.

    python3 -m venv osbee_testing
    source osbee_testing/bin/activate
    pip install osbee
    python3 examples/dump_status.py
    deactivate

You *should* see the status of your OSBee dumped out:

    $ python3 examples/dump_status.py
    type of timeout/max_runtime is <class 'int'>
    created OSBeeAPI at 192.168.0.1 max_runtime 30 (<class 'int'>)

    }

If you see an exception and/or stack-trace, file an Issue in github and let's chat about it.
