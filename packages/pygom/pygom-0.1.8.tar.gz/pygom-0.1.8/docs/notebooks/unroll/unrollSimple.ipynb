    "# Deducing transitions from equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Deducing ODEs from transitions is as simple as adding up all the different flows in and out of each state.\n",
    "In this process, information is lost regarding the nature (origin and destination) of the constituent transitions and so the reverse problem, deducing transitions from ODEs, is more difficult.\n",
    "PyGOM includes some tools to attempt to distinguish the implied flows between compartments given a set of equations, but given that multiple underlying flow configurations can separately explain an ODE system, this functionality should be used with caution.\n",
    "Here we demonstrate how this works in practice for two potentially tricky problems, the first of which is a system where the total population count is not conserved and the second is a system where a flow out of some of the compartments is split between multiple destinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SIR with births and deaths\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first example, let's consider the SIR model with standard incidence mixing and births and deaths proportional to the total population count, but not necessarily balanced:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d} S}{\\mathrm{d} t} &= -\\frac{\\beta SI}{N} + B N - \\mu S \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d} I}{\\mathrm{d} t} &= \\frac{\\beta SI}{N} - \\gamma I - \\mu I \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d} R}{\\mathrm{d} t} &= \\gamma I - \\mu R \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d} N}{\\mathrm{d} t} &= (B-\\mu)N\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the infection rate, $\\frac{\\beta SI}{N}$, depends on the total population, it is necessary to keep track of $N(t)$ in the final equation. \n",
    "Here we encounter an issue when thinking in terms of compartments:\n",
    "The total number of living individuals, $N$, is not a distinct category, rather, $S$, $I$ and $R$ are a subset of it.\n",
    "Thus, whilst valid to define a system of ODEs as we have done above, PyGOM will run into difficulties as it will interpret $N$ as a compartment.\n",
    "One solution could be to define $N$ as a time dependent parameter, however PyGOM does not currently have this functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we must be careful to ensure that we only pass state equations to PyGOM's transition calculating function, {func}`.get_unrolled_obj()`.\n",
    "The implication for the current example is that we eliminate the final equation and substitute $N=S+I+R$ everywhere else.\n",
