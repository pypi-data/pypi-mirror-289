    "# Solving Boundary Value Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to finding solutions for an initial value problem (IVP) and estimating unknown parameters, PyGOM also allows users to solve boundary value problems (BVPs) with a little bit of imagination.\n",
    "Here, we show how a BVP can be solved by treating it as a parameter estimation problem.\n",
    "Essentially, this is done via a shooting method where the first boundary condition defines the initial condition of an IVP and the second boundary condition is an observation.\n",
    "We use projectile motion as our example system, which we note is not relevant to disease modelling scenarios, but then BVPs are not commonly useful in this domain anyway."

    "Imagine launching a ball straight up into the air from a starting height $y(t=0)=0$. Ignoring air resistance, the ball will be pulled back to it's starting position under gravity.\n",

    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y}{\\mathrm{d} t^2}=-g\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g$ is acceleration due to gravity. Reducing this equation to two first order ODEs in terms of position and velocity, $v$, yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} t}&=v\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d} v}{\\mathrm{d} t}&=-g\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose that the ball lands 3 seconds later (i.e. $y(t=3)=0$).\n",
    "We will now solve two related BVPs in which the initial speed is unknown and later, the parameter $g$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unknown initial conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "First, assuming we know that the acceleration due to gravity is $g=10ms^{-2}$, we must estimate the initial velocity ($v(t=0)$) required to ensure that the ball lands 3 seconds later.\n",
    "This could be trivially solved via a quick analytical solution of the above equations resulting in $v(0)=15ms^{-1}$.\n",
    "Here we focus on demonstrating PyGOM's functionality, so this value will instead serve as a target we hope to reproduce.\n",
    "Another artefact of PyGOM, which will soon require changing, is that model parameters are automatically treated as unknowns.\n",
    "For this example, it means that we must specify parameters (in this case $g$) numerically in our equations:"
