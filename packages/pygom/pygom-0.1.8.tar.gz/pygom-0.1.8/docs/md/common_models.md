# Pre-defined examples - common epi models 

We have defined a set of models in the module {mod}`common_models`.
Most of these draw from commonly used models in epidemiology and are included primarily to save time for users, but also to serve as examples.
We also include a few models from outside of epidemiology which are commonly used for tasks such as testing numerical solvers.
