   abstract = {The annual incidence rates of some endemic infectious diseases are steady while others fluctuate dramatically, often in a regular cycle. In order to investigate the role of seasonality in driving cycles of recurrent epidemics, we analyze numerically the susceptible/exposed/infective/recovered (SEIR) epidemic model with seasonal transmission. We show that small-amplitude periodic solutions exhibit a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations as the amplitude of seasonal variation increases, predicting a transition to chaos of the kind studied in other biological contexts. The epidemiological implication is that the seasonal mechanism generating biennial epidemics may not be able to account for small-amplitude recurrent epidemics of arbitrary periodicity. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Theory implies that tau leaping should be accurate so long as no propensity function changes its value "significantly" during any time step τ. Presented here is an improved procedure for estimating the largest value for τ that is consistent with this condition. This new τ -selection procedure is more accurate, easier to code, and faster to execute than the currently used procedure.

There is a need for a consistent, interpretable and precise way to transfer data while maintaining its fidelity. We introduce 'EpiJSON', a new, flexible, and standards-compliant format for the interchange of epidemiological data using JavaScript Object Notation. This format is designed to enable the widest range of epidemiological data to be unambiguously held and transferred between people, software and institutions. In this paper, we provide a full description of the format and a discussion of the design decisions made. We introduce a schema enabling automatic checks of the validity of data stored as EpiJSON, which can serve as a basis for the development of additional tools. In addition, we also present the R package 'repijson' which provides conversion tools between this format, line-list data and pre-existing analysis tools. An example is given to illustrate how EpiJSON can be used to store line list data. EpiJSON, designed around modern standards for interchange of information on the internet, is simple to implement, read and check. As such, it provides an ideal new standard for epidemiological, and other, data transfer to the fast-growing open-source platform for the analysis of disease outbreaks.},

   abstract = {Van der Pol's equation for a relaxation oscillator is generalized by the addition of terms to produce a pair of non-linear differential equations with either a stable singular point or a limit cycle. The resulting “BVP model” has two variables of state, representing excitability and refractoriness, and qualitatively resembles Bonhoeffer's theoretical model for the iron wire model of nerve. This BVP model serves as a simple representative of a class of excitable-oscillatory systems including the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the squid giant axon. The BVP phase plane can be divided into regions corresponding to the physiological states of nerve fiber (resting, active, refractory, enhanced, depressed, etc.) to form a “physiological state diagram,” with the help of which many physiological phenomena can be summarized. A properly chosen projection from the 4-dimensional HH phase space onto a plane produces a similar diagram which shows the underlying relationship between the two models. Impulse trains occur in the BVP and HH models for a range of constant applied currents which make the singular point representing the resting state unstable. © 1961, The Biophysical Society.

   abstract = {The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis-Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain. The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches.

Using data from two epidemics [in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 1995 and in Uganda in 2000], we built a mathematical model for the spread of Ebola haemorrhagic fever epidemics taking into account transmission in different epidemiological settings. We estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) to be 2.7 (95% CI 1.9-2.8) for the 1995 epidemic in DRC, and 2.7 (95% CI 2.5-4.1) for the 2000 epidemic in Uganda. For each epidemic, we quantified transmission in different settings (illness in the community, hospitalization, and traditional burial) and simulated various epidemic scenarios to explore the impact of control interventions on a potential epidemic. A key parameter was the rapid institution of control measures. For both epidemic profiles identified, increasing hospitalization rate reduced the predicted epidemic size.},

A simple multi-patch (metapopulation) model for spatial heterogeneity in epidemics is analysed and we examine conditions under which patches become synchronized. We show that the patches in non-seasonal deterministic models often oscillate in phase for all but the weakest between patch coupling. Synchronization is also seen for stochastic models, although slightly stronger coupling is needed to overcome the random effects. We demonstrate that the inclusion of seasonal forcing in deterministic models can lead to the maintenance of phase differences between patches. Complex dynamic behaviour is observed in the seasonally forced spatial model, along with the coexistence of many different behaviours. Compared to the non-spatial model, chaotic solutions are observed for weaker seasonal forcing; these solutions have a more realistic minimum number of infectives.},

Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.},

However, in the cases hitherto considered on the basis of chemical dynamics, the oscillations were found to be of the damped kind, and therefore, only transitory (unlike certain experimentally observed periodic reactions). Furthermore, in a much more general investigation by the writer, covering the kinetics not only of chemical but also of biological systems, it appeared, from the nature of the solution obtained, improbable3 that undamped, permanent oscillations would arise in the absence of geometrical, structural causes, in the very comprehensive class of systems considered. For it seemed that the occurrence of such permanent oscillations, the occurrence of purely imaginary exponents in the exponential series solution presented, would demand peculiar and very specific relations between the characteristic constants of the systems undergoing transformation; whereas in nature these constants would, presumably, stand in random relation.},

Such equations represent changes in system outputs by linking the behaviour of derivatives of a process to the behaviour of the process itself. Current methods for estimating parameters in differential equations from noisy data are computationally intensive and often poorly suited to the realization of statistical objectives such as inference and interval estimation. The paper describes a new method that uses noisy measurements on a subset of variables to estimate the parameters defining a system of non-linear differential equations. The approach is based on a modification of data smoothing methods along with a generalization of profiled estimation. We derive estimates and confidence intervals, and show that these have low bias and good coverage properties respectively for data that are simulated from models in chemical engineering and neurobiology. The performance of the method is demonstrated by using real world data from chemistry and from the progress of the autoimmune disease lupus. © 2007 Royal Statistical Society.},

Often only parts of the model can be observed directly. Given a model that sufficiently describes the measured data, it is important to infer how well model parameters are determined by the amount and quality of experimental data. This knowledge is essential for further investigation of model predictions. For this reason a major topic in modeling is identifiability analysis. Results: We suggest an approach that exploits the profile likelihood. It enables to detect structural non-identifiabilities, which manifest in functionally related model parameters. Furthermore, practical non-identifiabilities are detected, that might arise due to limited amount and quality of experimental data. Last but not least confidence intervals can be derived. The results are easy to interpret and can be used for experimental planning and for model reduction. © The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

Cognitive neuroscience has seen rapid growth in the size and complexity of data recorded from the human brain as well as in the computational tools available to analyze this data. This data explosion has resulted in an increased use of multivariate, model-based methods for asking neuroscience questions, allowing scientists to investigate multiple hypotheses with a single dataset, to use complex, time-varying stimuli, and to study the human brain under more naturalistic conditions. These tools come in the form of “Encoding” models, in which stimulus features are used to model brain activity, and “Decoding” models, in which neural features are used to generated a stimulus output. Here we review the current state of encoding and decoding models in cognitive electrophysiology and provide a practical guide toward conducting experiments and analyses in this emerging field. Our examples focus on using linear models in the study of human language and audition. We show how to calculate auditory receptive fields from natural sounds as well as how to decode neural recordings to predict speech. The paper aims to be a useful tutorial to these approaches, and a practical introduction to using machine learning and applied statistics to build models of neural activity. The data analytic approaches we discuss may also be applied to other sensory modalities, motor systems, and cognitive systems, and we cover some examples in these areas. In addition, a collection of Jupyter notebooks is publicly available as a complement to the material covered in this paper, providing code examples and tutorials for predictive modeling in python. The aimis to provide a practical understanding of predictivemodeling of human brain data and to propose best-practices in conducting these analyses.},
