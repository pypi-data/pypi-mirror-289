# Zenif

Zenif is a powerful, highly customizable, and versatile Python module designed to enhance the efficiency and performance of your programs. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, Zenif offers a suite of tools to streamline your workflow and improve code management. Zenif currently enables developers with a simple yet highly customizable logger with support for multiple streams, a set of utility decorators, like `@cache` and `@rate_limiter`, and a handful of tools to create a command-line interface with interactive prompts and argument handling.
