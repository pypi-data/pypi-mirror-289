It is usually combined with filters, which handle lighting and composition in a particular way, or sometimes help emulate an art style. So a \"base model\" that produces \"boring\" results is the best, as it means any filters people create for it will make a big difference! 2. There is a very important difference between different models, that I like to call \"variability\". Models with low variability have very good prompt adherence, very good text rendering and are less likely to deform or duplicate body parts. So SD3 was deliberately made with super-low variability, because the devs know that filters which increase it can be made."
