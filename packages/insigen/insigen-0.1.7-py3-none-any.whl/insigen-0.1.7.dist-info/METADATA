                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

## Features of topic modelling
- Generating a distribution of generalized topics covered in a document/articler
- Extracting contextualized keywords from the text piece
- Generating a summary of the text
- Trained on a corpus of 6000 wikipedia articles for generalized topics
- Can be trained on custom data for more specific topics

## How to use the model
- Clone this repository
- Install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt`
- Basic Usage:

### Get a topic distribution

```python
from insigen import insigen
model = insigen()
topic_distribution = model.get_distribution(document)
```

#### Important parameters for `insigen`:
*  `use_pretrained_embeds`: Setting this parameter to False will allow you to train your own embeddings. Further parameters need to be specified for training
*  `embed_file`: This parameter should be used when you've trained your own embeddings. Specify the path to your sentence embeddings.
*  `dataset_file`: This parameter should be used when you've trained your own embeddings. Specify the path to your own dataset.
*  `embedding_model`: (Default = all-mpnet-base-v2) Insigen uses sentence bert models to train it's embeddings. Valid models are:

                all-distilroberta-v1
                all-mpnet-base-v2
                all-MiniLM-L12-v2
                all-MiniLM-L6-v2

Important parameters for `get_distribution`
* `document`: The text for which the topic distribution is to be generated
* `metric`: This metric defines how the topics will be found. Can be set to 'threshold', to get all the topics above a similarity threshold. Defaults to 'max'. 'Max' metric gets the top "n" topics
* `max_count`: This argument should be used with max metric. It specifies the top x amount of topics that get fetched. Defaults to 1.
* `threshold`: This argument should be used with threshold metric. It specifies the threshold similarity over which all topics will be fetched. Defaults to 0.5.


### Get keyword frequency

```python
frequency = model.get_keyword_frequency(document, min_len=2, max_len=3)

#Generate a wordcloud using the frequency
cloud = model.generate_wordcloud(frequency)
```

#### Important parameters for `get_keyword_frequency`
* `document`: The text for which the keyword frequency is to be generated
* `frequency_threshold`: minimum frequency of a n-gram to be considered in the keywords (`min_len` and `max_len` are also used to adjust the length of n-grams in the text)

### Generate Summary

```python
summary = model.generate_summary(article, topic_match=relevant_topic))

# To get a list of topics, use this
#print(model.unique_topics)
```

#### Import parameters for `generate_summary`
* `document`:The text for which the summary is to be generated
* `topic_match`: a topic that can match with the text. This adds additional weight to sentences that are more related to the topic. use `model.unique_topics` to get a list of topics that can match. Defaults to None, in which case weightage to related sentence will not be given.
* `topic_weight`: Adds weightage to the topic similarity score. Increasing this parameter results to more topic oriented summary. Defaults to 1.
* `similarity_weight`: Adds weightage to sentence similarity score. Increasing this parameter results in extracting more co-related sentences. Defaults to 1.
* `position_weight`: Adds weightage to the position of the sentences. Increasing this parameter results to more position oriented summary; i.e Texts present early in the document are given more weightatge. Defaults to 10.
* `num_sentences`: This specifies the number of sentences that are to be included in the summary. Defaults to 10.

### Train on your dataset

```python
embeddings = model.train_embeds(dataset)
```

#### Important parameters for `train_embeds`
* `dataset`: A pandas dataframe for the dataset to be trained
* `batch_size`: Batches to divide the dataset into. Defaults to 32.


## How does the model work? 

### Topic Distribution
- Create embedded vectors of labelled training articles
- Find mean embeddings of each topic in the corpus to create topic vectors and create clusters of articles\
  ![image](https://github.com/4RCAN3/insigen/assets/69053040/0180cc83-9369-43cb-85b3-ab2ec4ca947c)

- Use KNN to place new articles in the topic vector cluster\

- Chunking each article and finding relevant topic from the topic vectors\
  ![image](https://github.com/4RCAN3/insigen/assets/69053040/311cdfba-b8da-46a3-936f-3439162da5b5)

### Keyword extraction
- N-grams and keywords are filtered from the text
- Contextually similar keywords to the article are given higher scoring
- A threshold is applied to the filtered list of keywords to get the final list of keywords


### Summary Extraction
- The PageRank algorithm is used to create a similarity matrix for sentences in the text
- Additionally, sentences are scored based on their position in the text and their similarity to a relevant topic
- Top N sentences from the similarity matrix are extracted to create a summary.
