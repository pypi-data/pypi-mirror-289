Include figures and images.

Figures are included by referring to their file.
The source attribute refers to the image file, relative to the page. 
Usually it is a good idea to collect all images of a page or group of page in one folder, like shown below. 
Files are copied during the build process.

:tree:
- site/
    - pages/
        - index.md
        - hello.md
        - unit-1/
            - figures/
                - image.png
            - index.md
            - preparation.md

Formats can be `jpg`, `png`, `pdf`. 

Captions are recommended.
