# Prompt-AI

prompt-ai is an innovative library designed to optimize AI-driven applications by enhancing prompt handling and response generation. It leverages the Gemini API to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches by introducing a structured database management system.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Embedding Management**: ChatFlow stores pre-generated embeddings in a structured database, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving response times.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Manage datasets and dataframes efficiently, ensuring that embeddings are generated once and reused across multiple sessions.
- **Performance and Scalability**: The streamlined approach enhances performance and scalability, making ChatFlow ideal for chatbots, recommendation systems, and other AI-powered tools.
- **Versatile Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Node.js endpoint servers, bridging different technologies and workflows.

## Use Cases

- **Chatbots**: Build sophisticated chatbots with improved response times and efficiency.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Enhance recommendation engines with optimized prompt handling and response generation.
- **AI-Powered Tools**: Improve existing AI applications with a robust, scalable solution.
