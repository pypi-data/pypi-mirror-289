Changelog
==================


Version 0.1.2 (2024-08-12)
--------------------------

* [Bugfix] Fixed the initialization of the State. The previous versions included the mention of initializing the State with a custom dictionary, which was not implemented. This has been fixed now.
* [Bugfix] Changes the method accesed from the Executor class when an error should be raised. The Context did not have a dedicated method for error handling, but hangles them through "handle_signal".  The previous implementation of Executor accessed the "handle_error" not "handle_signal" methods.  Fixed now.
* [Bugfix] Fixed the issue with errors raised when the the user selects an option with no callback functions attached to it. The issue come from the fact that the Context was looking for an Executor with the option signature and failled, raising KeyError. Now, the error is ignored, forcing the desired behaviour.
* [Tests] Added tests for the State and Context classes.
* [Documentation] Created and updated the CHANGELOG.
* [Miscellaneous] Changed method name in State from "load" to "update", which makes more sense in this context.
* [Miscellaneous] Changed module name: "context2" become "context". Additionally included some explanations regarding the usage of the Context in the overall architecture.
* [Miscellaneous] Additional changes in naming, commenting and type returned by functions.
