The `apyxl` package (Another PYthon package for eXplainable Learning) is a simple wrapper around [`xgboost`](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python/index.html), [`hyperopt`](https://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/), and [`shap`](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It provides the user with the ability to build a performant regression or classification model and use the power of the SHAP analysis to gain a better understanding of the links the model builds between its inputs and outputs. With `apyxl`, processing categorical features, fitting the model using Bayesian hyperparameter search, and instantiating the associated SHAP explainer can all be accomplished in a single line of code, streamlining the entire process from data preparation to model explanation.

### Current Features:
- Automatic One-Hot-Encoding for categorical variables
- Basic hyperparameter optimization using `hyperopt` with K-Folds cross-validation
- Simple explainability visualizations using `shap` (`beeswarm`, `decision`, `force`, `scatter`)
- Focus on classification and regression tasks

### Planned Enhancements:
- Time-series data handling and normalization
- A/B test analysis capabilities

## Installation
To install the package, use:
```bash
pip install apyxl
```

## Basic Usage
Here's a simple example of how to use the `XGBRegressorWrapper` class:
```python
from apyxl import XGBRegressorWrapper
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes

# Load the diabetes dataset
X, y = load_diabetes(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)

# Initialize and fit the model
xgb = XGBRegressorWrapper()
xgb.fit(X, y)

# Generate a beeswarm plot
xgb.beeswarm(X)
```

```python
# Generate a dependence plot
xgb.scatter(X, feature='s5')
```

Please note that this package is still under development, and features may change or expand in future versions.
