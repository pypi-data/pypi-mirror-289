pygentest - Python Test Generators
===

<p>
<code>pygentest</code> is a Python library supporting several data generators. 

With <code>pygentest</code>, you can generate several type of data, from the simple like random ***character*** or ***string***, to the more complex such as ***graph***, ***tree***, ***convex lattice polygon***.

**You are very welcome to:**
- Install and use <code>pygentest</code>.
- Give feedbacks.
- Report issues and bugs.
- Provide ideas to improve this library.

<h2> Installation </h2>

<p>
You can simply install <code>pygentest</code> with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a>.

```
pip install pygentest
```
</p>

<h2> Other information </h2>

Currently, documentation is written for every function and class in <code>pygentest</code>. You can access it by using Python built-in <code>help</code> function. You can also read the documentation <a href=#Documentation>here</a>.

Detailed instruction has not been written yet, and it will be completed soon.

In the future, I will write a document that analyzes intuition, complexity, and efficiency of each generator.

The inspiration of this personal project comes from my task as an Algorithm Collaborator in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/code.mely/">Code Mely</a>: prepare problems for a contest and generate tests for each problem. I decided to write a Python library that could help generate complex structures, instead of rewrite the code many times.
