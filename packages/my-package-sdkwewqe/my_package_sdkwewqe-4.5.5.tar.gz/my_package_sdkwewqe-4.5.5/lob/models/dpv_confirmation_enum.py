    Result of Delivery Point Validation (DPV), which determines whether or not
    the address is deliverable by the USPS. Possible values are:
    * `Y` –– The address is deliverable by the USPS.
    * `S` –– The address is deliverable by removing the provided secondary
    unit designator. This information may be incorrect or unnecessary.
    * `D` –– The address is deliverable to the building's default address but

      There is a chance the mail will not reach the intended recipient.
    * `N` –– The address is not deliverable according to the USPS, but parts
    of the address are valid (such as the street and ZIP code).
    * `''` –– This address is not deliverable. No matching street could be
    found within the city or ZIP code.
