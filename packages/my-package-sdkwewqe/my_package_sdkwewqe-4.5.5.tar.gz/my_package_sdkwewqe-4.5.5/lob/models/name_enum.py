      * `In Transit` - The mailpiece is being processed at the entry/origin
      facility.
      * `In Local Area` - The mailpiece is being processed at the destination
      facility.
      * `Processed for Delivery` - The mailpiece has been greenlit for
        delivery at the recipient's nearest postal facility. The mailpiece
        should reach the mailbox within 1 business day of this tracking
        event.
      * `Delivered` - The mail piece has been delivered to 
        the recipientâ€™s address. The final scan is generated when the mail 
        carrier's GPS unit leaves the delivery area.
      * `Re-Routed` - The mailpiece is re-routed due to recipient change of
        address, address errors, or USPS relabeling of barcode/ID tag
        area.
      * `Returned to Sender` - The mailpiece is being returned to sender due
        to barcode, ID tag area, or address errors.
      
      * `International Exit` - The mail piece has been processed to 
        ship to a destination abroad. This is typically the last 
        scan a US-originated international mail piece will receive 
        from the USPS.
