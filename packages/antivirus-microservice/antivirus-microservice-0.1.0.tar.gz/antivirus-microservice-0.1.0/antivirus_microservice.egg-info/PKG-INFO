        # Antivirus Microservice Python Client
        
        This is a python client for the free and fully functional [Antivirus Microservice Server](https://github.com/ivanoff/Antivirus-Microservice). It allows you to easily integrate virus scanning capabilities into your PHP applications.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ...
        
        ## Usage
        
        Here's a basic example of how to use the Antivirus Microservice client:
        
        ```python
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            antivirus = AntivirusMicroservice()
            result = antivirus.check_file('path/to/your/file.txt')
            if result['ok']:
                print("File is clean")
            else:
                print(f"File is infected: {result['viruses']}")
        ```
        
        ## Error Handling
        
        The client handles basic errors:
        - If the file is not found, it returns `['ok' => false, 'viruses' => ['File not found']]`.
        - If there's an error communicating with the server, it returns `['ok' => false, 'viruses' => ['Error checking file']]`.
