    """
    Inject a specific volume into the chip using MUX. Do this at either fixed flowrate, fixed pressure or adaptive pressure. You can also use this as a threaded module and set the pressure/flow_rate externally, leaving this function to measure only (and switching off flow when volume has been injected.)

    parameters
    ----------
    ob1elve : ob1elve object
        object controlling ob1 pressure controller. I assume it is completely setup, and has sensors etc attached, connected, and set up. If you use flow-controlled option, make sure PID is allready setup.
    muxelve : muxelve object
        object controlling MUX distributor microfluidic switch
    pressure_channel : int
        Channel in which to control the pressure
    flowrate_sensor_channel : int
        Channel to which the flowrate sensor I use to measure volume is connected. Probably the same as pressure_channel
    inject_valve_channel : int
        Valve number from which I should take the thing to inject.
    volume : float (in µl)
        How much volume to inject.
    stop_valve_channel : int, optional
        At the end of an injection, I can switch of pressure, but it is safer to switch to a channel without connector, so there is no flowblack. And we are probably not using all 12 channels anyway. Set this to a unconnected plugged channel to do this. If left at False, I set the pressure/flow to zero at the end of an injection.
    pressure : float (in mbar), optional
        At what pressure to inject the liquid. If you leave at False, either set the pressure manually before starting this injection //or// set a goal flow_rate. Be carefull to not cause high flow rate!! This will cause unknown volumes to be injected > see maxflow
    max_flow : float (in µl/min), optional
        The flow sensor has a maxflow, above which it is no longer accurate, and the injected volume will be misjudged. Set this to the flowrate at which this function should warn the user. 
    flow_rate: float (in µl/min), optional
        At what flow rate to inject. If you leave at false, either set the pressure manually before starting this injection //or// set a goal pressure. Note that you need to initialize PID etc separately, this function does not do that for you.
    pollrate: float (in Hz), optional
        How often to check flow rate to estimate injected volume. Higher poll rate = better accuracy, but too fast will make things go wrong. I guessed 20 Hz as a good start, but not optimized.
