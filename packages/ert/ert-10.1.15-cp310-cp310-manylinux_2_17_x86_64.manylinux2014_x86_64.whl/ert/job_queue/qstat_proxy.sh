#
# This scripts can be used as a caching proxy for the executable `qstat`
# assumed to be present in $PATH.
#
# qstat output (the cache) will be stored in a file on /tmp
#
# Assumptions:
#  * Failures in qstat (or this proxy) are handled upstream by retrying.
#  * This script is not re-entrant. When the proxyfile is not created, but
#    it is locked, it will exit with a nonzero exit code.
#  * This script is significantly faster (when cache is fresh) than the
#    real qstat executable.
#  * This script will be called simultaneously up to thousands of times pr
#    second.
#
# Usage:
#  qstat_proxy.sh [options] [job_id] [proxyfile]
#
# ERTs torque driver will always call qstat with (any) options (starting
# with a '-'-character) and then the job_id

# Cache age that will trigger a cache update, in seconds:
CACHE_TIMEOUT=2

# A cache file older than this should not be used and will give an error
# (if the backend is not available)
CACHE_INVALID=10

QSTAT=`which qstat 2>/dev/null`

# This is a number that must be larger then largest amount of lines
# the qstat backend can display pr. job
MAX_JOB_LINES=200

QSTAT_OPTIONS=""
# while the first arg starts with a - character:
