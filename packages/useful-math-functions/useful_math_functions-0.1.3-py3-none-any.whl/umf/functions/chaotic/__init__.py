"""Chaotic functions for the UMF package.

!!! note "About Chaotic Functions"

    This module contains functions for generating chaotic time series data, which
    can be used for testing and benchmarking purposes. The functions are based on
    well-known chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz system and the RÃ¶ssler system or
    the Duffing oscillator. Also, examples from physical systems like the double
    pendulum or the magnetic pendulum are included.
