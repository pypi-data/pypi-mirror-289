# Abstract APIs

`abstract_apis` is a Python module designed to streamline HTTP request operations by abstracting away common setup procedures and processing details. It provides tools for constructing URLs and handling JSON data serialization automatically, making it easier to integrate API calls in your applications.

## Features

- Automates the creation and management of headers for JSON requests.
- Ensures JSON data serialization for outgoing requests.
- Provides utility functions to strip characters from strings and construct well-formed endpoints and URLs.
- Simplified functions for making GET and POST requests with optional endpoint concatenation.

## Installation

You can install the `abstract_apis` package directly from PyPI (when available):

```bash
pip install abstract_apis
```

## Usage

### Making a POST Request

To make a POST request to a specific endpoint with JSON data:

```python
from abstract_apis import make_requests

url = "https://api.example.com"
endpoint = "submit"
data = {"key": "value"}
response = make_requests.getPostRequest(url, data, endpoint=endpoint)
print(response)
```

### Making a GET Request

To make a GET request to a specific endpoint with query parameters:

```python
from abstract_apis import make_requests

url = "https://api.example.com"
endpoint = "fetch"
params = {"query": "info"}
response = make_requests.getGetRequest(url, params, endpoint=endpoint)
print(response)
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- `requests` library

Ensure you have the `requests` library installed:

```bash
pip install requests
```
