# Abstract APIs

`abstract_apis` is a Python module designed to simplify HTTP requests by abstracting common request setups and processing. It helps developers make GET and POST requests with JSON content easily, managing headers and data serialization internally.

## Features

- Automatic handling of request headers for JSON content types.
- Ensures data passed to requests is properly serialized into JSON.
- Simplified functions for making GET and POST requests.

## Installation

You can install the `abstract_apis` package directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install abstract_apis
```

## Usage

### Making a POST Request

To make a POST request with JSON data:

```python
from abstract_apis import make_requests

url = "https://api.example.com/data"
data = {"key": "value"}
response = make_requests.getPostRequest(url, data)
print(response)
```

### Making a GET Request

To make a GET request with query parameters:

```python
from abstract_apis import make_requests

url = "https://api.example.com/data"
params = {"query": "info"}
response = make_requests.getGetRequest(url, params)
print(response)
```

## Dependencies
