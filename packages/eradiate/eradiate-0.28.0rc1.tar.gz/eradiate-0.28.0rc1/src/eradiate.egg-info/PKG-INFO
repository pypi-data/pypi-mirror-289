Eradiate is a modern radiative transfer simulation software package for Earth
observation applications. Its main focus is accuracy, and for that purpose, it
uses the Monte Carlo ray tracing method to solve the radiative transfer
equation.

## Detailed list of features

<ul>
  <li><strong>Spectral computation</strong>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Solar reflective spectral region
  </summary>
  Eradiate ships spectral data within from 280 nm to 2400 nm. This range can be
  extended with additional data (just ask for it!).
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Line-by-line simulation
  </summary>
  These are true monochromatic simulations (as opposed to narrow band
  simulations).
  Eradiate provides monochromatic absorption datasets spanning the wavelength
  range [250, 3125] nm.
  It also supports user-defined absorption data provided it complies with the
  dataset format specifications.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Band simulation
  </summary>
  These simulations computes results in spectral bands.
  The correlated <em>k</em>-distribution (CKD) method with configurable
  quadrature rule is used. This method achieves a trade-off between performance
  and accuracy for the simulation of absorption by gases.
  Eradiate ships with absorption datasets suitable for use within the CKD
  method in spectral bands of variable width (including 1 nm and 10 nm
  wavelength bands and 100 cm^-1 wavenumber bands), from 250 nm up to 3125 nm.
  It also supports user-defined absorption data provided it complies with the
  dataset format specifications.
  </details>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Atmosphere</strong>

  <details>
  <summary>
  One-dimensional atmospheric profiles
  </summary>
  Both standard profiles, e.g. the AFGL (1986) profiles, and customized
  profiles are supported.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Plane-parallel and spherical-shell geometries
  </summary>
  This allows for more accurate results at high illumination and viewing
  angles.
  </details>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Surface</strong>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Lambertian and RPV reflection models
  </summary>
  Model parameters can be varied against the spectral dimensions.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Detailed surface geometry
  </summary>
  Add a discrete canopy model (either disk-based abstract models, or more
  realistic mesh-based models).
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Combine with atmospheric profiles
  </summary>
  Your discrete canopy can be integrated within a scene featuring a 1D
  atmosphere model in a fully coupled simulation.
  </details>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Illumination</strong>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Directional illumination model
  </summary>
  An ideal illumination model with a Delta angular distribution.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Many irradiance datasets
  </summary>
  Pick your favourite—or bring your own.
  </details>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Measure</strong>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Top-of-atmosphere radiance and BRF computation
  </summary>
  An ideal model suitable for satellite data simulation.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Perspective camera sensor
  </summary>
  Greatly facilitates scene setup: inspecting the scene is very easy.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Many instrument spectral response functions
  </summary>
  Our SRF data is very close to the original data, and we provide advice to
  further clean up the data, trading off accuracy for performance.
  </details>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Monte Carlo ray tracing</strong>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Mitsuba renderer as radiometric kernel
  </summary>
  We leverage the advanced Python API of this cutting-edge C++ rendering
  library.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  State-of-the-art volumetric path tracing algorithm
  </summary>
  Mitsuba ships a null-collision-based volumetric path tracer which performs
  well in the cases Eradiate is used for.
  </details>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Traceability</strong>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Documented data and formats
  </summary>
  We explain where our data comes from and how users can build their own data
  in a format compatible with Eradiate's input.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Transparent algorithms
  </summary>
  Our algorithms are researched and documented, and their implementation is
  open-source.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Thorough testing
  </summary>
  Eradiate is shipped with a large unit testing suite and benchmarked
  periodically against community-established reference simulation software.
  </details>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Interface</strong>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Comprehensive Python interface
  </summary>
  Abstractions are derived from computer graphics and Earth observation and
  are designed to feel natural to EO scientists.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Designed for interactive usage
  </summary>
  Jupyter notebooks are now an essential tool in the digital scientific
  workflow.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Integration with Python scientific ecosystem
  </summary>
  The implementation is done using the Scientific Python stack.
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary>
  Standard data formats (mostly NetCDF)
  </summary>
  Eradiate uses predominantly xarray data structures for I/O.
  </details>
  </li>
</ul>

## Authors and acknowledgements

Eradiate is developed by a core team consisting of Vincent Leroy,
Sebastian Schunke, Nicolas Misk and Yves Govaerts.

Eradiate uses the
[Mitsuba 3 renderer](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba3), developed by
the [Realistic Graphics Lab](https://rgl.epfl.ch/),
taking advantage of its Python interface and proven architecture, and extends it
with components implementing numerical methods and models used in radiative
transfer for Earth observation. The Eradiate team acknowledges Mitsuba creators
and contributors for their work.

The development of Eradiate is funded by the
[Copernicus programme](https://www.copernicus.eu/) through a project managed by
the [European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int/) (contract no
40000127201/19/I‑BG).
The design phase was funded by the [MetEOC-3 project](http://www.meteoc.org/)
(EMPIR grant 16ENV03).
