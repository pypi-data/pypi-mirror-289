# ManagedImageRoleType

RoleType signifies the role the image plays within the registry and the permissions users have for executing actions on the image.   - ROLE_TYPE_SYSTEM: The system role indicates that the image is generated and used by the managed image system and is critical to image building functionality. These images cannot be modified by users. System-level images are generated by the managed image system and are critical for building other images.  - ROLE_TYPE_USER_DEFINED: The user-defined role indicates that the image was created by users and that users can execute arbitrary actions on it.
