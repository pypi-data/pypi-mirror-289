# RimeLanguage

Language for generative language tasks.  User facing strings should match their ISO 639-1 code. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes for more details.   - LANGUAGE_EN: We use EN as the default value because prior to 2.10 we didn't have a language option  for generative testing, and we implicity assumed english was the language. By making EN the default we ensure these previous versions are compatible, and will default to using EN correctly. protolint:disable:next ENUM_FIELD_NAMES_ZERO_VALUE_END_WITH
