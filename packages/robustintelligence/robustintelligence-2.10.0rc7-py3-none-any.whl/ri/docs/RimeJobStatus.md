# RimeJobStatus

Status of the RimeJob.   - JOB_STATUS_PENDING: Resources have been created for the job but the job has not started yet.  - JOB_STATUS_FAILED: Blanket status for user or system-related job failure.  - JOB_STATUS_REQUESTED: The job descriptor exists but has no resources allocated. Jobs that remain in this status without moving to the PENDING status are at risk of entering the FAILED status.  - JOB_STATUS_CANCELLED: Job has been cancelled. Cancelled jobs cannot be recovered.
