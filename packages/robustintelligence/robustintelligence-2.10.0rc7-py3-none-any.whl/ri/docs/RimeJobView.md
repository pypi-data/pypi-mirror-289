# RimeJobView

Based on https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/design_patterns#resource_view.   - JOB_VIEW_BASIC: Server responses only include basic information about the job, including type, status, and some job data.  - JOB_VIEW_FULL: Server responses include all available information about the job, including progress. Has greater performance requirements than the Basic view.
