"""Performing research with eye-tracking equipment typically requires a long-term investment in software
tools to collect, process, and analyze data. Much of this involves real-time data collection, saccadic
analysis, calibration routines, and so on.
The EyeLinkÂ® eye-tracking system is designed to implement most of the required software base for data
collection and conversion. It is most powerful when used with the Ethernet link interface, which allows
remote control of data collection and real-time data transfer. The PyLink toolkit includes Pylink module,
which implements all core EyeLink functions and classes for EyeLink connection and the eyelink graphics,
such as the display of camera image, calibration, validation, and drift correct. The EyeLink graphics is
currently implemented using Simple Direct Media Layer (SDL: www.libsdl.org).


The Pylink library contains a set of classes and functions, which are used to program experiments on many
different platforms, such as MS-DOS, Windows, Linux, and the Macintosh. Some programming standards,
such as placement of messages in the EDF file by your experiment, and the use of special data types, have
been implemented to allow portability of the development kit across platforms. The standard messages
allow general analysis tools such as EDF2ASC converter or EyeLink Data Viewer to process your EDF files.
