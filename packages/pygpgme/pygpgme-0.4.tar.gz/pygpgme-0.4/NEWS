pygpgme-0.4: 2024-08-07

 * Modernise build system of the project and drop Python 2 support. We
   now require Python >= 3.10 to build.
 * Add documentation comments (Tim Allen)
 * Add support for pinentry mode (Werner Koch)
 * Extend gpgme.Context.export() to take an export_mode parameter
   (Daniele Ricci)
 * Add pubkey_algo and hash_algo attributes to Signature objects (Till Maas)
 * Convert enumeration and flag constants to use enum module
   types. All constants from 0.3 remain available under their old
   names for compatibility.
 * The module provides type information, including a stub for the C
   extension. This enables mypy type checking for users of the package.
 * The test suite has been updated to pass with modern GPG.

pygpgme-0.3: 2012-03-08

 * Add support for Python 3 (tested with Python 3.2).  Data being
   encrypted, decrypted, signed or verified is treated as bytes, while
   textual data (including textual representations of binary data like
   key IDs) uses the string/unicode type.
 * The test suite has been moved to the toplevel and is no longer
   installed with the extension.
 * The examples directory is now included in tarball releases.

pygpgme-0.2: 2011-08-17

 * Update the code base to work with newer versions of GPGME
 * Update extension code to make it easier to port to Python 3 (this
   version still doesn't support Python 3). In general, this involves
   making sure we return Unicode strings for textual data and byte
   strings for binary data.
 * Add support for the genkey API.
 * Add support for symmetric encryption in encrypt().

pygpgme-0.1: 2006-03-27

 * Initial Release.
