🧐 About
---------

Have you ever wanted to take your favorite offline playlist along?
— *I have.*

This script makes it easier to do that.
It converts your playlist with absolute paths
to playlist with relative paths,
and copies audio files to one folder with converted playlist.
The only thing that remains to be done is to move this folder
to your Android smartphone and open the playlist
(or let a player to discover media for you).

Although, there is only one conversion way
"Desktop `AIMP`_ -> `VLC for Android`_" for now, 
but who knows what the future holds for us?

🚀 Features
------------

*  Conversion from **AIMP** *(desktop)* .m3u / .m3u8 playlists
   into playlists suitable for playback in **VLC for Android**
   (with relative paths,
   replaced square brackets ``[`` ``]`` and *hash* ``#`` 
   in songs filenames)
*  Copying songs from .m3u / .m3u8 playlists into destination folder
   (after playlist conversion and only **.mp3** and **.flac** local files, for now)
*  Displaying only tracks from playlist
   *(without M3U tag lines / comments)*
*  Displaying a full content of playlist file
*  Creating a playlist from tracks of specified folder
   (with relative or absolute paths)
*  Injecting (appending) one playlist into another 
   (top or bottom)
*  Creating an empty playlist file
*  **TBD:** Copying and conversion paths to relative, without replacing characters
   ("make relative playlist")

🛠️ Requirements
----------------

* Python 3.9 and higher

Installing Python is no different than installing other apps for your OS.
Go to downloads page on `python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.
Download the latest version for your OS or any version higher than ``3.9.2``.
Then run Python installer and follow its steps.


💻 Installation
----------------

You can install *Playlist Along* via pip_ from PyPI_:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install playlist-along

I do recommend you to use `pipx`_ for any CLI Python package.
It let you install and run Python applications in isolated environments.

.. code:: console

   $ python -m pip install --user pipx
   $ pipx install playlist-along
   $ playlist-along --version
