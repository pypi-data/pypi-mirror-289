"""A nothing is an attempt to give Python a "bottom" type.

* unlike a true bottom, it can be instantiated as a singleton
* types like ~T|None and ~T|() act like a poor man's Optional/Maybe Monads
* both None and () make for lousy bottom types
* both don't accept many methods, None has no length, at least () is iterable
* when returning or iterating values, both must constantly be checked for
* many developers use None and () as sentinel values
* therefore by design Null & () are store-able in this data structure
