You can invoke it with `gradio cc` or `gradio component`<p class='tip'><strong>\u270d\ufe0f Tip:</strong> Run `gradio cc --help` to get a help menu of all available commands. There are some commands that are not covered in this guide. You can also append `--help` to any command name to bring up a help page for that command, e.g. `gradio cc create --help`.</p>\n\n## 1. create\n\nBootstrap a new template by running the following in any working directory:\n\n```bash\ngradio cc create MyComponent --template SimpleTextbox\n```\n\nInstead of `MyComponent`, give your component any name.\n\nInstead of `SimpleTextbox`, you can use any Gradio component as a template. `SimpleTextbox` is actually a special component that a stripped-down version of the `Textbox` component that makes it particularly useful when creating your first custom component.\nSome other components that are good if you are starting out: `SimpleDropdown`, `SimpleImage`, or `File`.<p class='tip'><strong>\u270d\ufe0f Tip:</strong> Run `gradio cc show` to get a list of available component templates.</p>\n\nThe `create` command will:\n\n1. Create a directory with your component's name in lowercase with the following structure:\n```directory\n- backend/ <- The python code for your custom component\n- frontend/ <- The javascript code for your custom component\n- demo/ <- A sample app using your custom component. Modify this to develop your component!\n- pyproject.toml <- Used to build the package and specify package metadata.\n```\n\n2. Install the component in development mode\n\nEach of the directories will have the code you need to get started developing!\n\n## 2. dev\n\nOnce you have created your new component, you can start a development server by `entering the directory` and running\n\n```bash\ngradio cc dev\n```\n\nYou'll see several lines that are printed to the console.\nThe most important one is the one that says:\n\n> Frontend Server (Go here): http://localhost:7861/\n\nThe port number might be different for you.\nClick on that link to launch the demo app in hot reload mode.\nNow, you can start making changes to the backend and frontend you'll see the results reflected live in the sample app!\nWe'll go through a real example in a later guide.<p class='tip'><strong>\u270d\ufe0f Tip:</strong> You don't have to run dev mode from your custom component directory. The first argument to `dev` mode is the path to the directory. By default it uses the current directory.</p>\n\n## 3. build\n\nOnce you are satisfied with your custom component's implementation, you can `build` it to use it outside of the development server.\n\nFrom your component directory, run:\n\n```bash\ngradio cc build\n```\n\nThis will create a `tar.gz` and `.whl` file in a `dist/` subdirectory.\nIf you or anyone installs that `.whl` file (`pip install <path-to-whl>`) they will be able to use your custom component in any gradio app!\n\nThe `build` command will also generate documentation for your custom component. This takes the form of an interactive space and a static `README.md`. You can disable this by passing `--no-generate-docs`. You can read more about the documentation generator in [the dedicated guide](https://gradio.app/guides/documenting-custom-components).\n\n## 4. publish\n\nRight now, your package is only available on a `.whl` file on your computer.\nYou can share that file with the world with the `publish` command!\n\nSimply run the following command from your component directory:\n\n```bash\ngradio cc publish\n```\n\nThis will guide you through the following process:\n\n1. Upload your distribution files to PyPi. This is optional. If you decide to upload to PyPi, you will need a PyPI username and password. You can get one [here](https://pypi.org/account/register/).\n2. Upload a demo of your component to hugging face spaces. This is also optional.\n\n\nHere is an example of what publishing looks like:\n\n<video autoplay muted loop>\n  <source src=\"https://gradio-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/text_with_attachments_publish.mov\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNow that you know the high-level workflow of creating custom components, you can go in depth in the next guides!\nAfter reading the guides, check out this [collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/gradio/custom-components-65497a761c5192d981710b12) of custom components on the HuggingFace Hub so you can learn from other's code.<p class='tip'><strong>\u270d\ufe0f Tip:</strong> If you want to start off from someone else's custom component see this [guide](./frequently-asked-questions#do-i-always-need-to-start-my-component-from-scratch).</p>\n", "tags": [], "spaces": [], "url": "/guides/custom-components-in-five-minutes/", "contributor": null}}
