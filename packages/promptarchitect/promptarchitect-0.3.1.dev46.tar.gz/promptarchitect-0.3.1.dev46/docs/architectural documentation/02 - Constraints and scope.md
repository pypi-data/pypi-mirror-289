# 2. Constraints

## 2.1 Technical Constraints

### AI Model Compatibility

- **Constraint**: The engineered prompts must be compatible with multiple AI models from different providers (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI, Open Source).
- **Rationale**: To ensure flexibility and usability across various AI platforms and maintain compatibility with future updates.
- **Impact**: Prompts must be designed and tested for compatibility with each supported AI model, considering differences in their API structures and response behaviors.

### Versioning and Documentation

- **Constraint**: Comprehensive versioning and documentation are mandatory for all engineered prompts.
- **Rationale**: To manage prompt evolution, facilitate maintenance, and ensure clarity in prompt usage.
- **Impact**: All changes to prompts must be tracked with version numbers, and documentation must be updated to reflect these changes, including the design rationale and expected outputs.

### Testing and Validation

- **Constraint**: Rigorous testing and validation procedures must be applied to all engineered prompts.
- **Rationale**: To ensure prompts generate the expected outputs reliably and consistently.
- **Impact**: Prompts require unit testing, integration testing, performance testing, and regression testing, which must be conducted regularly, especially after updates to the underlying AI models.

## 2.2 Organizational Constraints

### Development Process

- **Constraint**: A structured development process must be followed for creating and maintaining engineered prompts.
- **Rationale**: To ensure consistency, quality, and adherence to best practices in prompt engineering.
- **Impact**: Development teams must adhere to predefined processes for prompt creation, testing, validation, and deployment, as well as regular reviews and updates.

### Licensing

- **Constraint**: The project is licensed under the MIT License.
- **Rationale**: To provide clear terms under which the software can be used, modified, and distributed.
- **Impact**: All contributors and users must comply with the terms of the MIT License.

## 2.3 Regulatory Constraints

No regulatory constrains apply

## 2.4 Conventions

### Naming Conventions

- **Constraint**: Standard naming conventions must be used for prompt files and versions.
- **Rationale**: To ensure clarity and consistency in prompt identification and usage.
- **Impact**: All prompt files must follow the predefined naming conventions, including clear version identifiers and descriptive names.

### Coding Standards

- **Constraint**: Prompts must adhere to established coding standards and best practices.
- **Rationale**: To maintain code quality and readability.
- **Impact**: All code related to prompt execution must follow the agreed-upon coding standards, including documentation, formatting, and commenting practices.
