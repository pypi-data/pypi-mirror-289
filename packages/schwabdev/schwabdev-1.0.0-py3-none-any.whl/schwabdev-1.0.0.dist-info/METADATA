# Schwab-API-Python 
This is an unofficial python program to access the Schwab api.    
You will need a Schwab developer account [here](https://beta-developer.schwab.com/).  
Join the [Discord group](https://discord.gg/m7SSjr9rs9).  
Also found on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/schwabdev/), install via `pip3 install schwabdev` 


## Quick setup
1. Create a new Schwab individual developer app with callback url "https://127.0.0.1" (case sensitive) and wait until the status is "Ready for use", note that "Approved - Pending" will not work.
2. Enable TOS (Thinkorswim) for your Schwab account, it is needed for orders and other api calls.
3. Python version 3.11 or higher is required.     
4. `pip3 install schwabdev requests websockets tk` (tkinter/tk may need to be installed differently)
5. Import the package `import schwabdev`
6. Create a client `client = schwabdev.Client('Your app key', 'Your app secret')`
7. Examples on how to use the client are in `tests/api_demo.py`

## What can this program do?
 - Authenticate and access the api 
 - Functions for all api functions (examples in `tests/api_demo.py`)
 - Auto "access token" updates (`client.update_tokens_auto()`)
 - Stream real-time data with customizable response handler (examples in `tests/stream_demo.py`)
 ### TBD 
 - Automatic refresh token updates. (Waiting for Schwab implementation)

## Notes

The schwabdev folder contains code for main operations:     
 - `api.py` contains functions relating to api calls, requests, and automatic token checker threads.
 - `stream.py` contains functions for streaming data from websockets.
 - `terminal.py` contains a program for making additional terminal windows and printing to the terminal with color.
