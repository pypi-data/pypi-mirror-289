# Adaptive Cards Framework
## Baseline
### What are Adaptive Cards? 
Adaptive Cards are platform-agnostic snippets of UI, authored in JSON, that apps and services can openly exchange. When delivered to a specific app, the JSON is transformed into native UI that automatically adapts to its surroundings. It helps design and integrate light-weight UI for all major platforms and frameworks.

### Why do I need a framework?
Building an application that effectively serves Adaptive Cards can be complex and time-consuming. Without a framework, you'd need to thoroughly navigate the entire Adaptive Cards documentation to ensure proper implementation, which can slow down development and hinder scalability. While tools like the designer.io page can assist with prototyping and creating JSON components, relying solely on these can limit your application's growth potential. By leveraging a framework, you streamline the process, allowing you to focus on crafting your cards with confidence and efficiency, without the worry of underlying technical details.
