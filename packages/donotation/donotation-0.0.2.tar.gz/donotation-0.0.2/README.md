# Donotation

Donotation is a Python package that introduces Haskell-like do notation using a Python decorator. This decorator allows for the elegant composition of monadic operations by translating generator functions into a sequence of monadic `flat_map` method calls.

## Features

* Do Notation Decorator: Use the `@do` decorator to convert generator functions into monadic operations.
* Simplified Syntax: Write complex monadic sequences in a clean and readable way.
* Haskell-like Behavior: Emulate Haskell's do notation for monads in Python.

## Installation

You can install Do-notation using pip:

```
pip install donotation
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

First, import the do decorator from the do-notation package. Then, define a class implementing the `flat_map` method to represent the monadic operations. Finally, use the `@do` decorator on the generator function that yields objects of this class.

``` python
from donotation import do

class StateMonad:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def flat_map(self, func):
        def next(state):
            n_state, value = self.func(state)
            return func(value).func(n_state)

        return StateMonad(func=next)

def collect_even_numbers(num: int):
    def func(state: set):
        if num % 2 == 0:
            state = state | {num}

        return state, num
    return StateMonad(func)

@do
def example(init):
    x = yield collect_even_numbers(init+1)
    y = yield collect_even_numbers(init*x+1)
    z = yield collect_even_numbers(x*y+1)
    return collect_even_numbers(y*z+1)

state = set[int]()
state, value = example(3).func(state)
print(state)   # Output will be {4, 690}
```

In this example, we define a `StateMonad` class that implements a `flat_map` method to represent a state monad.
The helper method `collect_even_numbers` is used to generate a sequence of monadic operations within the generator function `example`, which stores the immediate values if they are even integer.
The `@do` decorator converts the generator function `example` into a sequence of `flat_map` calls on the `StateMonad` objects. 


### How It Works

The `@do` decorator works by substituting the yield statements with nested `flat_map` calls using the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the generator function. Here’s a breakdown of the process:

1. AST traversal: Traverse the AST of the generator function to inspect all statements.
2. Yield operation: When an yield operations is encountered, define an nested function containing the remaining statements. This nested function is then called within the `flat_map` method call.
3. If-else statements: If an if-else statement is encountered, traverse its AST to inspect all statements. If an yield statement is found, the nested function for the `flat_map` method includes the rest of the if-else statement and the remaining statements of the generator function.

## Decorator Implementation

Here is the pseudo-code of the `@do` decorator:

``` python
def do(fn):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        gen = fn(*args, **kwargs)

        def send_and_yield(value):
            try:
                next_val = gen.send(value)
            except StopIteration as e:
                result = e.value
            else:
                result = next_val.flat_map(send_and_yield)
            return result

        return send_and_yield(None)
    return wrapper
```

The provided code is a pseudo-code implementation that illustrates the core concept of the do decorator. 
The main difference between this pseudo-code and the actual implementation is that the function given to the `flat_map` method can only be called once in the pseudo-code, whereas in the real implementation, that function can be called arbitrarily many times.
This distinction is crucial for handling monadic operations correctly and ensuring that the do decorator works as expected in various scenarios.

### Yield Placement Restrictions

The yield operations within the generator can only be placed within if-else statements but not within for or while statements. Yield statements within the for or while statement are not substituted by a monadic `flat_map` chaining, resulting in a generator function due to the leftover yield statements. In this case, an exception is raised.

#### Good Example

Here’s a good example where the yield statement is only placed within if-else statements:

``` python
@do
def good_example():
    if condition:
        x = yield Monad(1)
    else:
        x = yield Monad(2)
    y = yield Monad(x + 1)
    return Monad(y + 1)

result = good_example()
```

#### Bad Example

Here’s a bad example where the yield statement is placed within a for or while statement:

``` python
@do
def bad_example():
    for i in range(3):
        x = yield Monad(i)
    return Monad(x + 1)

# This will raise an exception due to improper yield placement
result = bad_example()
```

### Translating a Generator Function to nested `flat_map` Calls

To better understand how the `@do` decorator translates a generator function into a nested sequence of `flat_map` calls, let's consider the following example function:

``` python
@do
def example():
    x = yield Monad(1)
    y = yield Monad(x + 1)
    z = yield Monad(y + 1)
    return Monad(z + 1)
```

The above function is conceptually translated into the following nested `flat_map` calls:

``` python
def example_translated():
    return Monad(1).flat_map(lambda x: 
        Monad(x + 1).flat_map(lambda y: 
            Monad(y + 1).flat_map(lambda z: 
                Monad(z + 1)
            )
        )
    )
```

This translation shows how each yield in the generator function corresponds to a `flat_map` call that takes a lambda function, chaining the monadic operations together.


### Advantages of the do Decorator

One significant advantage of the `@do` decorator is that it eliminates the need for nesting multiple `flat_map` calls and defining additional functions, which is often required when manually chaining monadic operations. This simplifies your code, making it more readable and maintainable.
