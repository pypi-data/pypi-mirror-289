This is a package for removing sensitive information from data, which utilizes automatic encoder, one-dimensional convolutional layer and bidirectional generative adversarial network to build a model to generate high-quality data.

It provides:

 - efficient feature extraction using multi-layer convolution
 - novel bidirectional generative adversarial network
 - secure sensitive information protection mechanism
 - high-quality data generation for practical applications
